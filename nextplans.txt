wrote a good 3 scenes for camera man. next things on the todo list- write two scenes where she creates a facebook and then finds the images, she does more research and finds the pictures of other victims and see that they're also moving slowly as well. scene- later that night she's resarching all these videos on THE CAMERA MAN, kinda montage. scene- she goes to work, tired, explaining the lore to Jeremy and Janet, who obviously don't believe her. she has started seeing the pictures so much they are like videos now, playing out deaths on camera that always end with a man with a head for a camera scene- she posts on reddit about the the pictures moving and seeing a man with a head for a camera and wanted to talk to anyone else, one dude messages her about how they should chat, but in person, computers not good big brother watching, she rolls her eyes and see another message popping up, reading, have you seen him in person yet? or whatever james says. She gets freaked out and closes her accounts, this happens at work- scene where she goes to work and she thinks she sees someone with a head for a camera on the trains. scene where she goes to work and things are fine, but then at dinner mario turns into CAMERAMAN. then, possibly the scene with the uber eats deliver driver. she gets fired for that, along with hacking the software. she is fired. scene- she tries to talk to old friends to use their phones. two doesn't work but one almost works. then she realizes she has to bite the bullet and get a phone. She gets a phone and opens her messages. She reaches out to the second guy. scene where they meet at a bar, he tells his tale about how his friend died. scene where they go to check in on the other guy, he's freaky so they leave, she forgot her phone in a rush and come back,they hear him screaming and bones crunching, they break in and there is a pool of blood with film reel. they are scared now and decide to go out. He always pops up where there's cameras. maybe we should go where there are no cameras. scene- they're deep in the forest, no cameras and ditch phones. it's dark and a light keeps coming in the distance. they go the other direction and the lights keep coming. at a certain point, their phones ding, a text rings-find your light. they go, she gets killed by CAMERAMAN and he ends it saying, Youre next. Ready for your close up?" "
