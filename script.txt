Story by Samekh Resh & James Spalding




Scene 1: first kill


Night- outside on the street 

A brownstone lit up under a beautiful and bright street lamp. A car pulls up to the streetlight. Out steps CAMERON, a gorgeously stunning influencer slash model. She’s wearing a tight, pink-clad body suit, with beautiful white pumps. She looks very 70’s. 

CAMERON
Ugh, which one is it? 

She goes on her social media, and goes to find the chat. She scrolls through influencer offers and dms to the party dm. She scrolls up to the picture. A boy, DALLAS, is cringely smiling before he begins to step back and scream, the shadow of a man with a big camera for a head coming into view. She checks her page, tons of followers. She goes to the homescreen. The camera icon. 

CAMERON
Another square for the grid wouldn't hurt. I look good as hell. 

She points the camera to herself, and over her shoulder is CameraMan. She screams. 

CAMERMAN (OS)
Beautiful as always. 

CAMERON
You again, creep. 

CAMERAMAN is a dapper, brogue-shoed, suit wearing classy man with a huge, old film camerama on his head. On his lapel is a flower made of film with a film handkerchief.

CAMERAMAN
Yes. Me again. 

CAMERON
Don't you ever get tired of following me. 

CAMERAMAN
Don't you like having followers? Isn't that all you want in your life? To have a bunch of people follow you so you can sell your empty products with their empty promises? Scamming people daily with teas you never drink, because your stomach is naturally flat, or work out programs you don't do, because you don't fucking work out. 

CAMERON
Yeah, i fucking hate sweating. It's bad for my skin. 

CAMERAMAN
Everything seems to be bad for you these days.

CAMERON
Yeah, I can feel this conversation is bad for me. Good bye freak. 

CAMERON walks away as CAMERAMAN watches.

CAMERAMAN
Weren't you going to take your selfie? 

CAMERON continues walking. 

CAMERAMAN
I bet it would've been perfect. 

CAMERON spins around. 

CAMERON
Yeah, because i'm fucking perfect. 

CAMERON spins around bumping into CAMERAMAN, who is holding something outstretched to her. 

CAMERAMAN
Then prove it, Ms. Narcissis. 

CAMERON goes to get her phone from her purse, searching endlessly to find it.

CAMERAMAN (OS)
You think you'd keep better track of this. 

She looks to CAMERAMAN, seeing he has it in his hands. 

CAMERAMAN
Another square for the grid, right? 

She shakily looks at him. Slow, old timey music starts to play.

CAMERON
What the fuck is that? 

CAMERAMAN(OS)
What is what? 
 
CAMERON
That fucking, that fucking ragtime depression era music. 

CAMERMAN
C'mon honey, we both have seen enough horror movies. 

She looks at him. 

CAMERAMAN
I would take it for you, but no one knows your angles like you.

She grabs the phone, shakily to take the picture. 

CAMERMAN
Oh my god, you gotta use the back camera for the perfect selfie. 

She turns the camera around. 

CAMERAMAN
Remember, 0.5 at that angle. 

CAMERON changes the settings up puts the camera up. She takes the pic with flash, immediately dropping the phone and running. 

She tries to run. 

CAMERAMAN (OS)
Camera shy? Now? 

Film reaches out like tentacles and grabs her and pulls her in. She falls and is dragged on the ground, and out of sight, her screams and the sounds of bones cracking. 

A hand reaches to pick up the phone. It's CAMERON's social media account. All of her posts have been wiped and only one post is on there. A hand picks up the phone. It clicks on the photo. CAMERON, sweaty, and distressed, is looking up at the camera. 

CAMERAMAN
And they pay for this shit. 

BLACK. 
CAMERMAN TITLECARD. 

SCENE 2: INTRO

Busy city streets. Early morning. Pigeons sit in Sonya windowsill as she gets ready for work. She dresses in brown and boring beige. She lives modestly, some would even call minimalist. A gas lamp sits on the bedside tables. Candles sit everywhere, some in random states of use. She puts on her clothes and heads out to work. 

Scene: Don't ever. 

SONYA walks along the busy street. When going on the metro, SONYA uses card and cash to pay while others simply tap their phones. SONYA reads a book on transit while others scroll on, or simply listen to, their phones. SONYA makes her way to her office building, a beautiful facade with rotating doors. 

Outside a hooded man is leaning against the doors. 

SONYA
Seriously? You're here again. 

MARCO
Heard you were working here. Like a cog. 

They stare at each other. 

SONYA
What do you need? 

MARCO
You. Like always. 

SONYA
I told you, after everything happened, I'm done. 

MARCO
Look, if we can just get on the company's system, I can take over from there with the code. 

SONYA
I don't want any parts Marco. 

MARCO
You don't wanna help the world. 

SONYA
How can I help the world if the government kills me. 

MARCO
How are you helping the world now? 

SONYA
Look, i gotta go to work.

MARCO
Okay Okay Okay, if I just give you a harddrive, could you be able to. 

SONYA
No Marco, don't fucking talk to me again. 
if we can just inside the company's Inside, two people are talking, ROBBIE the doorman and TINA the Guard. In front of them is a metal detector. 


ROBBIE and TINA
Hey SONYA. 

SONYA
Hey Guys. 

ROBBIE
What was that about?

SONYA
Nothing. 

INA
Like Usual.

They go back to talking, weirdly eyeing SONYA as she sets down her purse and takes off her watch 

TINA(laughing)
Sonya, you don't have to. 

SONYA
WHy? What's funny? 

ROBBIE
It's not like you have anything on you. 

TINA
Well, it is always the quiet, lonely types who kill. 

SONYA Stares at them. They Stare back. 

ROBBIE
She's just saying, statistically. 

SONYA stares at him. 

TINA
Girl, get out of here. Youre creepy as hell with that dead ass look. 

SONYA walks off. 

TINA
Like a fucking corpse. 

ROBBIE
I mean, what else can you expect from someone who doesn't have a-, 

ROBBIE notices SONYA is still there, watching. 

ROBBIE
Ain't you already late for work? Get!

TINA
She always in our damn business. She need to be fixing them damn computers.

ROBBIE
And her damn gut. YOu here her when she shits on that stool. 

TINA
Sounds like she murdering the toilet. 

ROBBIE
OKAY. Lonely, stanky ass. 

---

SONYA walks to her desk, a tiny cubicle. Nothing is on it, it is bare and simple, some files here and there but it is mainly organized. As she is getting ready for work, a muffin slowly rises behind her. Eventually, SONYA turns around to see it. 

SONYA
What the fuck Janet. 

Janet
Thank god you turned around, I didn't know how long I was gonna hold up my hand. 
SONYA
I repeat, Janet. What the fuck? 

Janet
Well, you didn't actually repeat that. You flipped it. Originaly, you said, What the fuck, Janet, But now you're saying, Janet, What the fuck. 

SONYA
It's the same thing. 

JANET
Well, syntactically, it's different. 

SONYA
It means the same thing. 

JANET
Semantically and syntactically, it could but i'm not here to split hairs with you, I can see time has done that enough with you. I'm here to help you. 

SONYA 
Help me?

JANET
Yes. Word around the office is, your booty hole is hotter than the 7th ring of hell due to all your diarrhea. So I just thought it would be the right thing to do. From one girl to the next. 

SONYA
What does us being women have to do with this?

Janet
All that shitting and backsplash...it's not good for your little lady. 

SONYA
my little lady? 

JANET
Your clam? 

SONYA
CLAM? 

JANET
I thought you'd get a seafood reference because the fish. 

SONYA
Fish? 

JANET
Taco box?

SONYA
Janet, please.

JANET
Your vagina, poo water splashing in your vagina is unhealthy. 

SONYA
This conversation is an HR violation. 

JANET
I am hr. 

SONYA
I know, which is part of why this is sad.

JANET
Do you want the muffin or not?

SONYA takes the muffin.

JANET
On yeah, I do forget. The meeting starts in five. 

Janet slinks beneath her cubicle sectioner. SONYA sighs and gathers her papers and leaves for the meeting room. 
------ 
SCENE: FIRST

Muted voices layer in the background as SONYA stares off. People laugh and talk while she is not engaged. it muffles more and more, becoming almost a muted mash-up, a quieted cacophony until someone claps. It's JANET. 

JANET
Ugh, good one Jeremy, you really should stop this accounting stuff and become a comedian. 

JEREMY
Aw, I've really been thinking about it-,

JANET
Seriously. You're bad at math. 

JEREMY
Wait, really, did I mess up-, 

JANET
JUST KIDDING, Since we're telling jokes. Anyway, before I ended the meeting, I just wanted to share something you guys won't believe. It's this new craze. 

Janet gathers them around her and searches on her phone. 

JANET
My son showed it to me the other day, weirdest little trend.

JEREMY
Oh, is this what I think it is. 

JANET
It's like some blue dress gold dress shit.

SONYA
What? 

JANET
Oh, here it is. 

She is on CAMERON's page. It is still just that page, with that one post. 

JANET
Apparently, people have been deleting all their socials, and posting one pictur, and just one caption-, 

She taps the picture and it moves, as if Cameron is slowly turning away. 

SONYA
What the fuck? 

JANET
Hashtag Say Cheese. So weird right? 

SONYA 
did you guys see that? 

JANET and JEREMY groan. 

SONYA
what was that about? 

JEREMY
Here we go. 

JANET
What? You see anything? 

SONYA
Why are you saying it like that? 

JANET
That's just bullcrap people say. They say they see it moving and BS. 

SONYA
Wait, show it to me again. 

JANET shows her the picture. This time, It moves even more, as if the phone is staying still as CAMERON turns away. 

SONYA
RIGHT THERE.

JEREMY
Right where? 

SONYA takes the phone from JANET, backs out and backs into it. CAMERON, again, moves from her pose to turning around, this time slightly more. Her hands have dropped from the camera, as if something else is holding it up for her. Her head is a blur, nothing but blonde hair turned three-quarters of the way around. 

SONYA
It just did it again. 

JEREMY and JANET share a look. JANET slowly takes her phone back. 

JANET
Please don't break my phone, if you're gonna break a phone, you should join the civilized world like the rest of us and finally get one. 

SONYA
I don't fucking need a phone-, 

JANET
We know, we know-, 

EVERYONE
The government is always watching. 

They all exit the room as SONYA sits.

------
SCENE: After work

SONYA packs up for the day and leaves work, saying good by to individuals as she leaves. She walks down the sidewalk and looks up at the sky. She reads her way through public transit and pays with cash. She walks past her house to an italian restuarant. She enters inside to a nice, quaint rustic style eatery. MARIO leans over the hosts bench. 

MARIO
Right on time sunshine. 

SONYA
Predictable girl. 

MARIO
not bad for our business. 

SONYA stands awkwardly. 

MARIO
Usual spot and order? 

SONYA
It's never any different.

SONYA sits at a table for one, while MARIO immediately brings her a bottle of wine. MARIO cracks open the wine and pours for her. When he stops, she slides it to him. He smirks and pours more. She takes a big swig of her wine. MARIO types on his phone a bit before the bell dings. He brings the food over to SONYA's table. 

SONYA
That was-, 

MARIO
Quick? yeah well-, 

He motions to the empty diner. MARIO pulls out the parmesean grindr. 

MARIO
Say when. 

SONYA let's him go. He repeats say when two more times before she stops him. He sits down at a booth nearby when his phone dings. He shakes his head. 

MARIO
Not this shit again Romero. 

He goes back to texting and the phone dings again. He looks at SONYA eating. 

MARIO
Hey Sonya, lemme ask you something. 

He comes to her booth. 

MARIO
You heard of the-, 

He looks at her. 

MARIO
Wait, I just remembered you live under the rock. 

SONYA
That's the point of being tech free. 

MARIO
What kinda super hacker goes tech free. 

SONYA
The one that knows too much. 

MARIO
Okay lady, you sound like a Matrix Character. Anyway, my friends keep trying to send me pics of this challenge to see if I see anything, but no one ever says they see anything. 

SONYA
What? 

MARIO shows her picture of CAMERON and this time, she moves more, almost starting into a sprint. 

SONYA
Jesus fucking christ is she running? 

MARIO
RUnning? What? 

SONYA
Don't fuck with me Mario. 

MARIO
You don't fuck with me? She just taking a selfie. 

SONYA looks at the picture again and it starts from her on the selfie to her beginning to sprint. 

SONYA
Now she's running farther. 

MARIO
Oh...Okay then. 

SONYA
No seriously, just let me show you. 

SHe tries to grab MARIO's phone. He struggles with her until she let's go. PAULIE is staring from the kitchen. MARIO stares at her, too. 

MARIO
I gotta tend to some tables. 

SONYA
MARIO sorry i just-, 

MARIO
It's cool. 

SONYA
I'm sorry. I'm-, 

MARIO
If you wanna see it just watch on your phone. 

SONYA
No phone, remember. 

MARIO
You can always get one again. Instead of trying to break mine. You got that strong ass grip, girl. I thought you'd crack my fucking phone. 

SONYA
Maybe. Maybe. 

MARIO
I mean, you're not doing any of that... stuff anymore. 
SONYA eats in thought. 

SCENE

NIGHT-BED. 

SONYA lays in her bed, awake. The short clip of CAMERON replays. In her head. She tosses and turns and tries to sleep but she simply cannot.

SCENE 2

Morning-the next day.

SONYA is groggily typing at work, unrested from the night before. She looks around before typing in reddit on her computer. It's blocked by the network. 

SONYA
Hey Jeremy!

He pops his head up over the cubicle.

JEREMY
Heya.

SONYA 
Good God, you're too happy in the morning. 

JEREMY
And depression rules your life. 

JANET
Jeremy! What did I tell you about being honest?

JEREMY
It's not meant for the modern world. 

SONYA
And you guys are our HR department?

JEREMY
Could be worse. We could be an actual corporate entity, then you'd really hate us. 

SONYA
Okay, well, I was trying to search up a coding colution online, and the one website that seemed to give good solutions was Reddit-,

JEREMY
Ooooh, I  know what you're gonna ask and it's a no go.

SONYA
What was I gonna ask?

JANET (in a mocking tone)
Can wwe have facebook? Can we have Twitter? Can we have myspace?

SONYA
who wants myspace

JEREMY
The Last remaining millenials. 

He looks SONYA up and down. 

SONYA
I'm Late Gen Z. 

JEREMY
Very. 

JANET
but it's company policy. No social media. We're here to work. If you wanna scroll Ticking Tock.

In the moment, JANET opens up a social media app. 

SONYA
Hey, can I see that for a second. 

JANET
What-, 

SONYA snatches the phone and looks for CAMERON's account. Janet snatches her phone back.

JANET
Oh my god, are you still on this?

SONYA
You really don't see it. 

Janet Looks at her. SONYA snatches back JANET's phone and shows her the picture. It moves as she points. JEREMY walks over to look and shares a glance with JANET. He gently grabs the phone. 

JEREMY
Yes... we see. a phone... magic. 

SONYA
No, the pictures moving. You can see her. She's turning away and running. 

It becomes ppin quiet. SONYA looks around to see the whole office is staring at her, including TINA and ROBBIE.  

TINA
I don't know y'all, that sounds like psychosis but imma shut up. 

ROBBIE
You think she Gonna snap soon? I put my money on next Wednesday.
 
TINA and ROBBIE walk away. 

SONYA rolls her eyes. ON her computer, she opens her terminal and starts getting to work. She's typing fast, navigating through folders, opening and editing files, testing network connections. Eventually, she opens a browser, types in reddit and it works. 

SONYA
Still got it. 

She creates a profile, her name is not-delulu-iswear-89. And she starts to research The Cameraman. She goes between making social media accounts to go to the pages of the disappeared people.She starts with CAMERON and sees the entirety of her last moments. Her running away, being grabbed by film and falling down, being dragged out of frame. A man steps into view, he has the head of an old film camera and is wearing a lovely suit. He leans in and points at SONYA. She exits the screen. Curious, she searches up a list of victims on reddit, and comes upon a small CAMERAMAN reddit page. She joins and reads a post about the curse of CAMERAMAN, she reads sections outloud. 

SONYA
Spread through selfies....pictures start moving.....asks you to take the perfect selfie?....KILLS YOU???? what? this can't? 

JANET
Whatcha saying there girlie? 

SONYA
Nothing.

JEREMY
She said something about kill. 

JANET
Ugh, there's always one you gotta keep your eye out for in the office. 

SONYA rolls her eyes and breathes. She thinks. Then she goes and makes a post, the header: Just wanna talk. 

She types: Hey everyone, I know this CAMERAMAN shit seems stupid but-i don't wanna sound crazy-i actually saw it. Like I saw some of the pictures move whenever I saw them. Well, I only saw one picture, The one with that CAMERON girl? It's like every time I see it, it starts to play out, more and more like a bad horror movie. I just wanna... talk to someone else, if they've seen it too, by some way. Don't be a dick and make fun of me. This is serious. I feeel like I'm going crazy. Thanks. 

She watches the pictures-become videos, increasingly showing more and more of how they are sucked away, grabbed and ensnared by film strips, being dragged to their death. She is watching another one, a picture of a man, in a forest, he looks sweaty and tired, loooking up from the ground. The picture shows him crawling backwards as film ensanres him. She watches the other two pictures as they play out. A beefcake by the name of JASON YOON shown, flexing his muscles, his facing screaming with fear. He's sweaty, but pale. In the mirror, you can't make out who is taking the picture. He tries to run, but trips on a weight and hits his head. Another girl, MINA OTESS. It shows her, standing, completely still in the rain, still face frozen and full of fear. A hand reaches out into the frame and grabs her neck. Film ensnares her face. And she is sucked into the screen. She goes back to her reddit post and puts and edit:

Yeah guys, no, I'm definitelys eeing them. It's like they're geting wrapped up in film. I don't get it. please HELP I FEEL LIKE I'M GOING CRAZY.   

The day moves around SONYA as she watches the pictures play out and read articles. SONYA is in a vortex of information, unaware of the outside world when JANET sets a muffin on the table. 

JANET
Daily fiber girly. 

SONYA
Thanks Janet. 

JANET is about to leave when she notices SONYA isn't leaving. 

JANET
Squash that big bug. 

SONYA
WHat? 

JANET
I just have been hearing you code all day, and usually you're gone by 5. 

SONYA
It's five? 

JANET
30, yes girlie you've been working. Remember to lock up. 

Scene: up all night

A montage. 


video one: 
a young man, wearing glasses is on the screen
Personally, I think it began in 2020 after covid hit the wave. We were all tied to our screens, tied to our cameras when soemthing happened. It was as if something was awakened. 

video two: 
No one thinks it's strange? 5 goung people with their lives ahead of them, thriving lives, all delete their socials, with one selfie, #saycheese, and they're never to be found again. And we're just supposed to believe it's suicide because that's what the cops found out? I think it's a government Psyop. No... a conspiracy. It's probably experimentation. 

video three:
There have only been 4 so far, CAMERON being the one who put it on the map, as she was a famous influencer who just disappeared. Personally, I think it's a mass psychosis brought upon bby 21st century mundane madness. People are so obsessed with perfection that fulfillment is lacking, and the soul suffers. It harkens to depression, deleting everything. I just don't understand the whole, #saycheese thing. Is it a meme?

SONYA stares at her computer, tired and in bewilderment. She goes to check her reddit post to see she's got two response: 

1. yeah bitch you are going crazy. get a dose of cobenfy. 

She googles what cobenfy is and schizophrenia pops up. She rolls her eyes and checks for the seond. 

2. lol attention whore. 
 
She rolls her eyes and goes back to doing her research. 

SCENE: THE LORE\\SONYA's PResentation

Morning-The office Exterior as JANET and JEREMY are giggling,Walking towards the doors. They enter, going through the hallway and rounding a corner to a racoon eyed, tired and disheveled SONYA. 

SONYA
HI. 

JANET
Jesus Christ. 

Jeremy
Jumpscare. 

SONYA
Good morning Good morning. Did you all sleep well? 

JANET
Did you even? 

SONYA
No, but that's not the point. I'll prove it to you. 
 
JEREMY
Prove What-,

She pulls both JEREMY and JANET by their arms into the meeting room. A powerpoint is running. 

okay okay okay. So. the first one was Hiroki, Mitsuri. 

She clicks a button and it shows Hiroki, Happy and smiling holding a camera, about to take a picture. 

SONYA
He was a japanese boy in indiana. He had a love for photography and filmmaking and set out to film the world during the lockdown. he's making movies and making work, and then all of a sudden, he goes missing. But nothing on his profiles or websites or anything but one picture. 

SONYA points to a picture with Hiroki, wide eyed with a forced smile, teary and snot faced at what seems to be a bridge. 

SONYA
They have never found his body either. 

She clicks a beautiful girl with curly hair is on th dancefloor, glowing. 

SONYA
INA Washington, a student at Westmonty high. Cheerleader, apparently a sweet girl and not suicidal. 

CLICK. INA at the edge of a forest. Her eyes a bleary and far away but she forces up a smile and two fingers. 

SONYA
This was her last picture near Garamound Forest, and she hasn't been found. 

click. A picture of a handsome man. Paul Logan. Brown hair, grunge looking but sweet. He sits on a couch with a black boy, James Hardy.  

SONYA
Pay attention to the one with brown hair. That's Paul Logan. Freshmen loner in college. 

CLICK. Paul is in the middle of the forest, on the ground, appearing to be backing up but smiling. His eyes scream terror. 

SONYA
This was paul's final moment. He has yet to be found. And this. 

CLICK. 

SONYA
IS CAMERON WALKER. Beautiful influencer and model. 

CLICK. 

SONYA
Her last picture taken was on the same street where she was supposed to go to a party. The uber drive who dropped her off said that she seemed fine when he left. 

JANET
OKAY....

SONYA
Don't you guys see, something is hunting them.

She flips through slides of the other people. 

SONYA
Something is hunting people and taking them and no one takes it seriously.  

JEREMY
Yeah, it's the spirit of depression. it gets the best of us.  

He mimics blowing his brains out and him and Janet laugh. 

SONYA
Guys, this is serious, something is taking people. 

JANET
And this has taken up enough of my time. Thanks for the early mornign presentation. 

SONYA
But Janet. 

JEREMY
I would go home, maybe get some sleep. 

He pats her dark circles. 

JEREMY (cont) 
Yeah, you've been up all fucking night. Get some beauty sleep. 

SONYA looks at them bewildered. 

SONYA
Do you guys jsut not care? 

JEREMY 
No. 

JANET
NEVER DID. 

SONYA stands there. 

Scene: a good night's sleep. 
SONYA goes home and rests. She takes off her clothes and looks around at the mess. She laughs and cleans up her apartmetn, athering dirty dishes and clothing from the floor and furniture. She takes a pot, and fills it with water, and puts it on the stove to boil. She gets out a can of RAGU and a sauce pan. She butters the pan, and sets it on the hot burner. she adds some garlic and onion to the pan. With the water now boiling next to her, she puts in pasta. She get's out beef and outs it in the pan, seasons it with various seasoning. Cooks her meat, adds some sauce to it once it browns and drains her pasta, saving a little bit of pasta water, which she adds to the pan. She rinses the pasta under colds water and then puts it in the pan, mixing everything together. SHe puts a huge handful of cheese on the plate and places pasta on top and mixes it. She reads a books and breathes. She brushes her teeth, showers and reads a bit before bed. She lays and rests her head with a small smile. 
 
SCENE: too much. 

The next day, midday. SOnya is typing at work. She looks back and forth to check if the coast is clear, then goes on reddit. She's only got one message. from a user. been-that-niqqa-69.It reads:

Yoooo brooooooooooooooo i been seeing the same shit too and I got an explanation for alll of it man. We gotta meet up in person, ya know. BIG BROTHER is watching. 

SONYA rolls her eyes. 

SONYA
This is useless. 

JANET
What is? Jack? 

Jack sits in a small costume. Jack is very cute. 

JANET
We keep him around because he's cute. that's a purpose. 

JEREMY walks over to pinch this 30 year old man's cheeks and tickle him. 

JANET
You doing ookay honey, you seem more unhinged than usual, and most days you're like a door that's almost been ripped off by an axe murderer.

SONYA
I-, and you're really the HR personnel. 

JANET
Lead HR Manager here. 

SONYA
Oh My GOD. Yeah, it's just this CAMERAMAN THING. 

JANET
You gotta put that shit to rest. That stuff is for teenage boys who are losers. A man witha  camera for a head. How the fuck is that scary. He's got a camera for a head. Break his lens.

JEREMY
Right mom, that's like punching him in the eye. 

JANET
and anyone who gets punched in the eye is taken aback. Even animals like lions. And they're predators. 

JEREMY
Wait, so you're still seeing THE CINEMATOGRAPHER-, 

SONYA
that's not his name, 

JANET
NO, it's- THE VIDEOGRAPHER. 

JEREMY AND JANET laugh as SONYA rolls her eyes. 

The rest of the day mulls on as work hushes. We see SONYA about to prep for work as everyone leaves when she looks at her computer one last time. She runs back to it and loads it. It's slow as fuck. When it eventually comes on, she goes to reddit. She has two new messages one from ben-that-niqqa-69 and one from wannabe-davenport-fag-18. She clicks on wannabe-davenport-fag18. It reads: 

You've seen him in the pictures, but have you seen him outside the pictures yet?   
SONYA is a bit confused by this and types: Like in real life. 

Instantly, wannabe-davenport-fag-18 messages back: Yes. If so you don't have long. 

She instantly exits out of reddit, turns off her computer and leaves. 

SONYA
These people are fucking crazy. 

TINA
takes one to know one. 

SONYA
What did you say TINA. 

TINA
Watch it girl, you get too rowdy and i got a gun. 

SONYA leaves. 

scene
SCENE did I just see?

Sonya walks down the subway station stairs and into the crowd of people. She's walking on the subway platform. She leans on a pillar, and closes her eyes. She brethes in and out. She opens her eyes, she sees something in the distance. Farther, down the platform, a man in a suit and a tie with a camera for a head is waving at her. SONYA rubs her eyes as the train arrives. She looks back and the man isn't there.

SONYA laughs as she enters and sit down on the train.

SONYA
No... I'm not. I was just joking. 

MARIO

TINA

TINA

Tina unlocks the doors and let's SONYA in. She runs to her computer. 

ROBBIE
I ain't never seen that girl run. Nowhere. It looks freaky. 

TINA
I think it's because of her gait. 

ROBBIE
She gay? I thought she was just trans. 

TINA
HEr gait. the way sh walks. 

ROBBIE
that's what you get for using special words. You're misunderstood by the illiterates. And we outnumber you.

SONYA loads her computer and waits impatiently. As soon as it loads she runs to reddit to message wannabe-davenport-fag-18:

TINA

SONYA
He was right here. 

The courier stands up with a camera on a landyard around him. 

SONYA
Why the fuck do you have a camera. 

COURIER
I like taking pictures of sidewalks. 

JASON
What? 

COURIER
I have an instagram account, walk_on_this_side. it's like a archival project. it's like that dude who likes to take pictures of alleys, or the guy who takes pictures of doors, but it's like more... like a combination on uniformity and how individual still creeps in due to time, lack of repair and bureacratic systems-, 

JANET
Look Kid, you're getting on my nerves, you need to leave. I hate artists. 

SONYA
You hate artists? 

JANET 
THIS ISN"T ABOUT ME RIGHT NOW. 

SONYA looks around as every stares at her. 

SCENE SABBATICAL

SONYA sits in an office chair. The Boss,TINA, Jeremy, JANET, and the COURIER are on the other side. The courier is eating a donut. 

THE BOSS
So, again-, 

SONYA

THE BOSS
A man... with a camera for a head instantly appeared to you where the courier just was, to kill you. 

SONYA

THE BOSS

SONYA

THE BOSS turns his computer monitor around to replay footage. SONYA punches The COURIER in the face and continues to beat him as he flails back and falls. 

THE BOSS
You really woulda been something in the ring. 

HE can't take his eyes off it. 

THE BOSS 
My bets would always be on you. 

JANET
Wait, replay that-, 

THE BOSS
Oh this one? 

He replays the punch. 

THE BOSS
Just think about it. You put four dollars in, you're at least getting four dollars back with this one. But, Sonya, even though you've got a great left hook, this really... isn't... the place for that... You know we have a zero tolerance policy for violence in this building. 

SONYA
No, i know I know, and I'm sorry I just. 

THE BOSS
Sonya, sweetheart, you know what this means? 

THE COURIER makes a noise sipping from his straw. 

THE COURIER
Do we have anymore coffee left? 

SONYA
why the fuck is he here? 

THE BOSS
Behave, you better be lucky he doesn't sue us. 

THE COURIER
It's cool. It's chill. I'm used to people hallucinating and punching me. My grandpa has dementia. 

The room moans in agreement and consolation. 

SONYA
Doesn't he have fucking things to deliver. 

THE COURIER
Well, I actually do this part tiem, and you were the last one of the day, so I'm actually really free from now on. 

THE BOSS
Do you program? 

SONYA
Wait wait wait, look. I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry okay. I've just. Lately I haven't been sleeping a lot, and I think it's just alck of sleep, Ya know. Like I haven't been getting enough good sleep, and when you don't get enough good sleep, you can start to have mild hallucinations and the can go from mild to wild depending about how long you've been getting little sleep. 

THE BOSS
Look. Look. I hate when people beg and explain themselves, it's really depressing to me. I'm not going to kill you. I'm just going to suggest you take a-, 

He Looks at JANET. 

JANET

THE BOSS
YEah, a sabbatical. Take some time, Take a break, get some sleep. And rest.

SONYA
Well, for how long. 

The room is quiet. 

SONYA
For how long? 

THE BOSS
I fear that's a conversation for later, when we see some progress? Hmm? I think that's a fair better deal than losing your job and getting charges pressed for assault? 

SONYA is quiet. and stares on as they look at her. 

THE COURIER
But do we have anymore coffee?

She runs through an alley way and hops some fences. She runs through a park and then cuts through a backyard. She comes around the corner and she's at her apartment. She runs in, takes off her shoes, goes to her closet and pulls out a safe. She breaks through and inside is stacks of cash and money. She grabs a few dollars and shoves them in her pockets. She thinks and grabs a few more. And then a few more. She runs and puts her shoes on and runs out the door. She's running Through the park, then over the fence, then up the hill. She dings back into the store. 

PHONE ATTENDANT
OH My Gosh, that was so quick. 

SONYA is breathing extremely hard. The PHONE ATTENDANT shows her his phone, a timer is running at 12 minutes and 39 seconds.

PHONE ATTENDANT has the rest of the money in their hands. SONYA runs out with her phoen as she types on it. The PHONE ATTENDANT shrugs and counts the money. 

PHONE ATTENDANT
