Story by Samekh Resh & James Spalding




Scene 1: first kill


Night- outside on the street 

A brownstone lit up under a beautiful and bright street lamp. A car pulls up to the streetlight. Out steps CAMERON, a gorgeously stunning influencer slash model. She’s wearing a tight, pink-clad body suit, with beautiful white pumps. She looks very 70’s. 

CAMERON
Ugh, which one is it? 

She goes on her social media, and goes to find the chat. She scrolls through influencer offers and dms to the party dm. She scrolls up to the picture. A boy, DALLAS, is cringely smiling before he begins to step back and scream, the shadow of a man with a big camera for a head coming into view. She checks her page, tons of followers. She goes to the homescreen. The camera icon. 

CAMERON
Another square for the grid wouldn't hurt. I look good as hell. 

She points the camera to herself, and over her shoulder is CameraMan. She screams. 

CAMERMAN (OS)
Beautiful as always. 

CAMERON
You again, creep. 

CAMERAMAN is a dapper, brogue-shoed, suit wearing classy man with a huge, old film camerama on his head. On his lapel is a flower made of film with a film handkerchief.

CAMERAMAN
Yes. Me again. 

CAMERON
Don't you ever get tired of following me. 

CAMERAMAN
Don't you like having followers? Isn't that all you want in your life? To have a bunch of people follow you so you can sell your empty products with their empty promises? Scamming people daily with teas you never drink, because your stomach is naturally flat, or work out programs you don't do, because you don't fucking work out. 

CAMERON
Yeah, i fucking hate sweating. It's bad for my skin. 

CAMERAMAN
Everything seems to be bad for you these days.

CAMERON
Yeah, I can feel this conversation is bad for me. Good bye freak. 

CAMERON walks away as CAMERAMAN watches.

CAMERAMAN
Weren't you going to take your selfie? 

CAMERON continues walking. 

CAMERAMAN
I bet it would've been perfect. 

CAMERON spins around. 

CAMERON
Yeah, because i'm fucking perfect. 

CAMERON spins around bumping into CAMERAMAN, who is holding something outstretched to her. 

CAMERAMAN
Then prove it, Ms. Narcissis. 

CAMERON goes to get her phone from her purse, searching endlessly to find it.

CAMERAMAN (OS)
You think you'd keep better track of this. 

She looks to CAMERAMAN, seeing he has it in his hands. 

CAMERAMAN
Another square for the grid, right? 

She shakily looks at him. Slow, old timey music starts to play.

CAMERON
What the fuck is that? 

CAMERAMAN(OS)
What is what? 
 
CAMERON
That fucking, that fucking ragtime depression era music. 

CAMERMAN
C'mon honey, we both have seen enough horror movies. 

She looks at him. 

CAMERAMAN
I would take it for you, but no one knows your angles like you.

She grabs the phone, shakily to take the picture. 

CAMERMAN
Oh my god, you gotta use the back camera for the perfect selfie. 

She turns the camera around. 

CAMERAMAN
Remember, 0.5 at that angle. 

CAMERON changes the settings up puts the camera up. She takes the pic with flash, immediately dropping the phone and running. 

She tries to run. 

CAMERAMAN (OS)
Camera shy? Now? 

Film reaches out like tentacles and grabs her and pulls her in. She falls and is dragged on the ground, and out of sight, her screams and the sounds of bones cracking. 

A hand reaches to pick up the phone. It's CAMERON's social media account. All of her posts have been wiped and only one post is on there. A hand picks up the phone. It clicks on the photo. CAMERON, sweaty, and distressed, is looking up at the camera. 

CAMERAMAN
And they pay for this shit. 

BLACK. 
CAMERMAN TITLECARD. 

SCENE 2: INTRO

Busy city streets. Early morning. Pigeons sit in Sonya windowsill as she gets ready for work. She dresses in brown and boring beige. She lives modestly, some would even call minimalist. A gas lamp sits on the bedside tables. Candles sit everywhere, some in random states of use. She puts on her clothes and heads out to work. 

Scene: Don't ever. 

SONYA walks along the busy street. When going on the metro, SONYA uses card and cash to pay while others simply tap their phones. SONYA reads a book on transit while others scroll on, or simply listen to, their phones. SONYA makes her way to her office building, a beautiful facade with rotating doors. 

Outside a hooded man is leaning against the doors. 

SONYA
Seriously? You're here again. 

MARCO
Heard you were working here. Like a cog. 

They stare at each other. 

SONYA
What do you need? 

MARCO
You. Like always. 

SONYA
I told you, after everything happened, I'm done. 

MARCO
Look, if we can just get on the company's system, I can take over from there with the code. 

SONYA
I don't want any parts Marco. 

MARCO
You don't wanna help the world. 

SONYA
How can I help the world if the government kills me. 

MARCO
How are you helping the world now? 

SONYA
Look, i gotta go to work.

MARCO
Okay Okay Okay, if I just give you a harddrive, could you be able to. 

SONYA
No Marco, don't fucking talk to me again. 
if we can just inside the company's Inside, two people are talking, ROBBIE the doorman and TINA the Guard. In front of them is a metal detector. 


ROBBIE and TINA
Hey SONYA. 

SONYA
Hey Guys. 

ROBBIE
What was that about?

SONYA
Nothing. 

INA
Like Usual.

They go back to talking, weirdly eyeing SONYA as she sets down her purse and takes off her watch 

TINA(laughing)
Sonya, you don't have to. 

SONYA
WHy? What's funny? 

ROBBIE
It's not like you have anything on you. 

TINA
Well, it is always the quiet, lonely types who kill. 

SONYA Stares at them. They Stare back. 

ROBBIE
She's just saying, statistically. 

SONYA stares at him. 

TINA
Girl, get out of here. Youre creepy as hell with that dead ass look. 

SONYA walks off. 

TINA
Like a fucking corpse. 

ROBBIE
I mean, what else can you expect from someone who doesn't have a-, 

ROBBIE notices SONYA is still there, watching. 

ROBBIE
Ain't you already late for work? Get!

TINA
She always in our damn business. She need to be fixing them damn computers.

ROBBIE
And her damn gut. YOu here her when she shits on that stool. 

TINA
Sounds like she murdering the toilet. 

ROBBIE
OKAY. Lonely, stanky ass. 

---

SONYA walks to her desk, a tiny cubicle. Nothing is on it, it is bare and simple, some files here and there but it is mainly organized. As she is getting ready for work, a muffin slowly rises behind her. Eventually, SONYA turns around to see it. 

SONYA
What the fuck Janet. 

Janet
Thank god you turned around, I didn't know how long I was gonna hold up my hand. 
SONYA
I repeat, Janet. What the fuck? 

Janet
Well, you didn't actually repeat that. You flipped it. Originaly, you said, What the fuck, Janet, But now you're saying, Janet, What the fuck. 

SONYA
It's the same thing. 

JANET
Well, syntactically, it's different. 

SONYA
It means the same thing. 

JANET
Semantically and syntactically, it could but i'm not here to split hairs with you, I can see time has done that enough with you. I'm here to help you. 

SONYA 
Help me?

JANET
Yes. Word around the office is, your booty hole is hotter than the 7th ring of hell due to all your diarrhea. So I just thought it would be the right thing to do. From one girl to the next. 

SONYA
What does us being women have to do with this?

Janet
All that shitting and backsplash...it's not good for your little lady. 

SONYA
my little lady? 

JANET
Your clam? 

SONYA
CLAM? 

JANET
I thought you'd get a seafood reference because the fish. 

SONYA
Fish? 

JANET
Taco box?

SONYA
Janet, please.

JANET
Your vagina, poo water splashing in your vagina is unhealthy. 

SONYA
This conversation is an HR violation. 

JANET
I am hr. 

SONYA
I know, which is part of why this is sad.

JANET
Do you want the muffin or not?

SONYA takes the muffin.

JANET
On yeah, I do forget. The meeting starts in five. 

Janet slinks beneath her cubicle sectioner. SONYA sighs and gathers her papers and leaves for the meeting room. 
------ 
SCENE: FIRST

Muted voices layer in the background as SONYA stares off. People laugh and talk while she is not engaged. it muffles more and more, becoming almost a muted mash-up, a quieted cacophony until someone claps. It's JANET. 

JANET
Ugh, good one Jeremy, you really should stop this accounting stuff and become a comedian. 

JEREMY
Aw, I've really been thinking about it-,

JANET
Seriously. You're bad at math. 

JEREMY
Wait, really, did I mess up-, 

JANET
JUST KIDDING, Since we're telling jokes. Anyway, before I ended the meeting, I just wanted to share something you guys won't believe. It's this new craze. 

Janet gathers them around her and searches on her phone. 

JANET
My son showed it to me the other day, weirdest little trend.

JEREMY
Oh, is this what I think it is. 

JANET
It's like some blue dress gold dress shit.

SONYA
What? 

JANET
Oh, here it is. 

She is on CAMERON's page. It is still just that page, with that one post. 

JANET
Apparently, people have been deleting all their socials, and posting one pictur, and just one caption-, 

She taps the picture and it moves, as if Cameron is slowly turning away. 

SONYA
What the fuck? 

JANET
Hashtag Say Cheese. So weird right? 

SONYA 
did you guys see that? 

JANET and JEREMY groan. 

SONYA
what was that about? 

JEREMY
Here we go. 

JANET
What? You see anything? 

SONYA
Why are you saying it like that? 

JANET
That's just bullcrap people say. They say they see it moving and BS. 

SONYA
Wait, show it to me again. 

JANET shows her the picture. This time, It moves even more, as if the phone is staying still as CAMERON turns away. 

SONYA
RIGHT THERE.

JEREMY
Right where? 

SONYA takes the phone from JANET, backs out and backs into it. CAMERON, again, moves from her pose to turning around, this time slightly more. Her hands have dropped from the camera, as if something else is holding it up for her. Her head is a blur, nothing but blonde hair turned three-quarters of the way around. 

SONYA
It just did it again. 

JEREMY and JANET share a look. JANET slowly takes her phone back. 

JANET
Please don't break my phone, if you're gonna break a phone, you should join the civilized world like the rest of us and finally get one. 

SONYA
I don't fucking need a phone-, 

JANET
We know, we know-, 

EVERYONE
The government is always watching. 

They all exit the room as SONYA sits.

------
SCENE: After work

SONYA packs up for the day and leaves work, saying good by to individuals as she leaves. She walks down the sidewalk and looks up at the sky. She reads her way through public transit and pays with cash. She walks past her house to an italian restuarant. She enters inside to a nice, quaint rustic style eatery. MARIO leans over the hosts bench. 

MARIO
Right on time sunshine. 

SONYA
Predictable girl. 

MARIO
not bad for our business. 

SONYA stands awkwardly. 

MARIO
Usual spot and order? 

SONYA
It's never any different.

SONYA sits at a table for one, while MARIO immediately brings her a bottle of wine. MARIO cracks open the wine and pours for her. When he stops, she slides it to him. He smirks and pours more. She takes a big swig of her wine. MARIO types on his phone a bit before the bell dings. He brings the food over to SONYA's table. 

SONYA
That was-, 

MARIO
Quick? yeah well-, 

He motions to the empty diner. MARIO pulls out the parmesean grindr. 

MARIO
Say when. 

SONYA let's him go. He repeats say when two more times before she stops him. He sits down at a booth nearby when his phone dings. He shakes his head. 

MARIO
Not this shit again Romero. 

He goes back to texting and the phone dings again. He looks at SONYA eating. 

MARIO
Hey Sonya, lemme ask you something. 

He comes to her booth. 

MARIO
You heard of the-, 

He looks at her. 

MARIO
Wait, I just remembered you live under the rock. 

SONYA
That's the point of being tech free. 

MARIO
What kinda super hacker goes tech free. 

SONYA
The one that knows too much. 

MARIO
Okay lady, you sound like a Matrix Character. Anyway, my friends keep trying to send me pics of this challenge to see if I see anything, but no one ever says they see anything. 

SONYA
What? 

MARIO shows her picture of CAMERON and this time, she moves more, almost starting into a sprint. 

SONYA
Jesus fucking christ is she running? 

MARIO
RUnning? What? 

SONYA
Don't fuck with me Mario. 

MARIO
You don't fuck with me? She just taking a selfie. 

SONYA looks at the picture again and it starts from her on the selfie to her beginning to sprint. 

SONYA
Now she's running farther. 

MARIO
Oh...Okay then. 

SONYA
No seriously, just let me show you. 

SHe tries to grab MARIO's phone. He struggles with her until she let's go. PAULIE is staring from the kitchen. MARIO stares at her, too. 

MARIO
I gotta tend to some tables. 

SONYA
MARIO sorry i just-, 

MARIO
It's cool. 

SONYA
I'm sorry. I'm-, 

MARIO
If you wanna see it just watch on your phone. 

SONYA
No phone, remember. 

MARIO
You can always get one again. Instead of trying to break mine. You got that strong ass grip, girl. I thought you'd crack my fucking phone. 

SONYA
Maybe. Maybe. 

MARIO
I mean, you're not doing any of that... stuff anymore. 
SONYA eats in thought. 

SCENE

NIGHT-BED. 

SONYA lays in her bed, awake. The short clip of CAMERON replays. In her head. She tosses and turns and tries to sleep but she simply cannot.

SCENE 2

Morning-the next day.

SONYA is groggily typing at work, unrested from the night before. She looks around before typing in reddit on her computer. It's blocked by the network. 

SONYA
Hey Jeremy!

He pops his head up over the cubicle.

JEREMY
Heya.

SONYA 
Good God, you're too happy in the morning. 

JEREMY
And depression rules your life. 

JANET
Jeremy! What did I tell you about being honest?

JEREMY
It's not meant for the modern world. 

SONYA
And you guys are our HR department?

JEREMY
Could be worse. We could be an actual corporate entity, then you'd really hate us. 

SONYA
Okay, well, I was trying to search up a coding colution online, and the one website that seemed to give good solutions was Reddit-,

JEREMY
Ooooh, I  know what you're gonna ask and it's a no go.

SONYA
What was I gonna ask?

JANET (in a mocking tone)
Can wwe have facebook? Can we have Twitter? Can we have myspace?

SONYA
who wants myspace

JEREMY
The Last remaining millenials. 

He looks SONYA up and down. 

SONYA
I'm Late Gen Z. 

JEREMY
Very. 

JANET
but it's company policy. No social media. We're here to work. If you wanna scroll Ticking Tock.

In the moment, JANET opens up a social media app. 

SONYA
Hey, can I see that for a second. 

JANET
What-, 

SONYA snatches the phone and looks for CAMERON's account. Janet snatches her phone back.

JANET
Oh my god, are you still on this?

SONYA
You really don't see it. 

Janet Looks at her. SONYA snatches back JANET's phone and shows her the picture. It moves as she points. JEREMY walks over to look and shares a glance with JANET. He gently grabs the phone. 

JEREMY
Yes... we see. a phone... magic. 

SONYA
No, the pictures moving. You can see her. She's turning away and running. 

It becomes ppin quiet. SONYA looks around to see the whole office is staring at her, including TINA and ROBBIE.  

TINA
I don't know y'all, that sounds like psychosis but imma shut up. 

ROBBIE
You think she Gonna snap soon? I put my money on next Wednesday.
 
TINA and ROBBIE walk away. 

SONYA rolls her eyes. ON her computer, she opens her terminal and starts getting to work. She's typing fast, navigating through folders, opening and editing files, testing network connections. Eventually, she opens a browser, types in reddit and it works. 

SONYA
Still got it. 

She creates a profile, her name is not-delulu-iswear-89. And she starts to research The Cameraman. She goes between making social media accounts to go to the pages of the disappeared people.She starts with CAMERON and sees the entirety of her last moments. Her running away, being grabbed by film and falling down, being dragged out of frame. A man steps into view, he has the head of an old film camera and is wearing a lovely suit. He leans in and points at SONYA. She exits the screen. Curious, she searches up a list of victims on reddit, and comes upon a small CAMERAMAN reddit page. She joins and reads a post about the curse of CAMERAMAN, she reads sections outloud. 

SONYA
Spread through selfies....pictures start moving.....asks you to take the perfect selfie?....KILLS YOU???? what? this can't? 

JANET
Whatcha saying there girlie? 

SONYA
Nothing.

JEREMY
She said something about kill. 

JANET
Ugh, there's always one you gotta keep your eye out for in the office. 

SONYA rolls her eyes and breathes. She thinks. Then she goes and makes a post, the header: Just wanna talk. 

She types: Hey everyone, I know this CAMERAMAN shit seems stupid but-i don't wanna sound crazy-i actually saw it. Like I saw some of the pictures move whenever I saw them. Well, I only saw one picture, The one with that CAMERON girl? It's like every time I see it, it starts to play out, more and more like a bad horror movie. I just wanna... talk to someone else, if they've seen it too, by some way. Don't be a dick and make fun of me. This is serious. I feeel like I'm going crazy. Thanks. 

She watches the pictures-become videos, increasingly showing more and more of how they are sucked away, grabbed and ensnared by film strips, being dragged to their death. She is watching another one, a picture of a man, in a forest, he looks sweaty and tired, loooking up from the ground. The picture shows him crawling backwards as film ensanres him. She watches the other two pictures as they play out. A beefcake by the name of JASON YOON shown, flexing his muscles, his facing screaming with fear. He's sweaty, but pale. In the mirror, you can't make out who is taking the picture. He tries to run, but trips on a weight and hits his head. Another girl, MINA OTESS. It shows her, standing, completely still in the rain, still face frozen and full of fear. A hand reaches out into the frame and grabs her neck. Film ensnares her face. And she is sucked into the screen. She goes back to her reddit post and puts and edit:

Yeah guys, no, I'm definitelys eeing them. It's like they're geting wrapped up in film. I don't get it. please HELP I FEEL LIKE I'M GOING CRAZY.   

The day moves around SONYA as she watches the pictures play out and read articles. SONYA is in a vortex of information, unaware of the outside world when JANET sets a muffin on the table. 

JANET
Daily fiber girly. 

SONYA
Thanks Janet. 

JANET is about to leave when she notices SONYA isn't leaving. 

JANET
Squash that big bug. 

SONYA
WHat? 

JANET
I just have been hearing you code all day, and usually you're gone by 5. 

SONYA
It's five? 

JANET
30, yes girlie you've been working. Remember to lock up. 

Scene: up all night

A montage. 


video one: 
a young man, wearing glasses is on the screen
Personally, I think it began in 2020 after covid hit the wave. We were all tied to our screens, tied to our cameras when soemthing happened. It was as if something was awakened. 

video two: 
No one thinks it's strange? 5 goung people with their lives ahead of them, thriving lives, all delete their socials, with one selfie, #saycheese, and they're never to be found again. And we're just supposed to believe it's suicide because that's what the cops found out? I think it's a government Psyop. No... a conspiracy. It's probably experimentation. 

video three:
There have only been 4 so far, CAMERON being the one who put it on the map, as she was a famous influencer who just disappeared. Personally, I think it's a mass psychosis brought upon bby 21st century mundane madness. People are so obsessed with perfection that fulfillment is lacking, and the soul suffers. It harkens to depression, deleting everything. I just don't understand the whole, #saycheese thing. Is it a meme?

SONYA stares at her computer, tired and in bewilderment. She goes to check her reddit post to see she's got two response: 

1. yeah bitch you are going crazy. get a dose of cobenfy. 

She googles what cobenfy is and schizophrenia pops up. She rolls her eyes and checks for the seond. 

2. lol attention whore. 
 
She rolls her eyes and goes back to doing her research. 

SCENE: THE LORE\\SONYA's PResentation

Morning-The office Exterior as JANET and JEREMY are giggling,Walking towards the doors. They enter, going through the hallway and rounding a corner to a racoon eyed, tired and disheveled SONYA. 

SONYA
HI. 

JANET
Jesus Christ. 

Jeremy
Jumpscare. 

SONYA
Good morning Good morning. Did you all sleep well? 

JANET
Did you even? 

SONYA
No, but that's not the point. I'll prove it to you. 
 
JEREMY
Prove What-,

She pulls both JEREMY and JANET by their arms into the meeting room. A powerpoint is running. 

okay okay okay. So. the first one was Hiroki, Mitsuri. 

She clicks a button and it shows Hiroki, Happy and smiling holding a camera, about to take a picture. 

SONYA
He was a japanese boy in indiana. He had a love for photography and filmmaking and set out to film the world during the lockdown. he's making movies and making work, and then all of a sudden, he goes missing. But nothing on his profiles or websites or anything but one picture. 

SONYA points to a picture with Hiroki, wide eyed with a forced smile, teary and snot faced at what seems to be a bridge. 

SONYA
They have never found his body either. 

She clicks a beautiful girl with curly hair is on th dancefloor, glowing. 

SONYA
INA Washington, a student at Westmonty high. Cheerleader, apparently a sweet girl and not suicidal. 

CLICK. INA at the edge of a forest. Her eyes a bleary and far away but she forces up a smile and two fingers. 

SONYA
This was her last picture near Garamound Forest, and she hasn't been found. 

click. A picture of a handsome man. Paul Logan. Brown hair, grunge looking but sweet. He sits on a couch with a black boy, James Hardy.  

SONYA
Pay attention to the one with brown hair. That's Paul Logan. Freshmen loner in college. 

CLICK. Paul is in the middle of the forest, on the ground, appearing to be backing up but smiling. His eyes scream terror. 

SONYA
This was paul's final moment. He has yet to be found. And this. 

CLICK. 

SONYA
IS CAMERON WALKER. Beautiful influencer and model. 

CLICK. 

SONYA
Her last picture taken was on the same street where she was supposed to go to a party. The uber drive who dropped her off said that she seemed fine when he left. 

JANET
OKAY....

SONYA
Don't you guys see, something is hunting them.

She flips through slides of the other people. 

SONYA
Something is hunting people and taking them and no one takes it seriously.  

JEREMY
Yeah, it's the spirit of depression. it gets the best of us.  

He mimics blowing his brains out and him and Janet laugh. 

SONYA
Guys, this is serious, something is taking people. 

JANET
And this has taken up enough of my time. Thanks for the early mornign presentation. 

SONYA
But Janet. 

JEREMY
I would go home, maybe get some sleep. 

He pats her dark circles. 

JEREMY (cont) 
Yeah, you've been up all fucking night. Get some beauty sleep. 

SONYA looks at them bewildered. 

SONYA
Do you guys jsut not care? 

JEREMY 
No. 

JANET
NEVER DID. 

SONYA stands there. 

Scene: a good night's sleep. 
SONYA goes home and rests. She takes off her clothes and looks around at the mess. She laughs and cleans up her apartmetn, athering dirty dishes and clothing from the floor and furniture. She takes a pot, and fills it with water, and puts it on the stove to boil. She gets out a can of RAGU and a sauce pan. She butters the pan, and sets it on the hot burner. she adds some garlic and onion to the pan. With the water now boiling next to her, she puts in pasta. She get's out beef and outs it in the pan, seasons it with various seasoning. Cooks her meat, adds some sauce to it once it browns and drains her pasta, saving a little bit of pasta water, which she adds to the pan. She rinses the pasta under colds water and then puts it in the pan, mixing everything together. SHe puts a huge handful of cheese on the plate and places pasta on top and mixes it. She reads a books and breathes. She brushes her teeth, showers and reads a bit before bed. She lays and rests her head with a small smile. 
 
SCENE: too much. 

The next day, midday. SOnya is typing at work. She looks back and forth to check if the coast is clear, then goes on reddit. She's only got one message. from a user. been-that-niqqa-69.It reads:

Yoooo brooooooooooooooo i been seeing the same shit too and I got an explanation for alll of it man. We gotta meet up in person, ya know. BIG BROTHER is watching. 

SONYA rolls her eyes. 

SONYA
This is useless. 

JANET
What is? Jack? 

Jack sits in a small costume. Jack is very cute. 

JANET
We keep him around because he's cute. that's a purpose. 

JEREMY walks over to pinch this 30 year old man's cheeks and tickle him. 

JANET
You doing ookay honey, you seem more unhinged than usual, and most days you're like a door that's almost been ripped off by an axe murderer.

SONYA
I-, and you're really the HR personnel. 

JANET
Lead HR Manager here. 

SONYA
Oh My GOD. Yeah, it's just this CAMERAMAN THING. 

JANET
You gotta put that shit to rest. That stuff is for teenage boys who are losers. A man witha  camera for a head. How the fuck is that scary. He's got a camera for a head. Break his lens.

JEREMY
Right mom, that's like punching him in the eye. 

JANET
and anyone who gets punched in the eye is taken aback. Even animals like lions. And they're predators. 

JEREMY
Wait, so you're still seeing THE CINEMATOGRAPHER-, 

SONYA
that's not his name, 

JANET
NO, it's- THE VIDEOGRAPHER. 

JEREMY AND JANET laugh as SONYA rolls her eyes. 

The rest of the day mulls on as work hushes. We see SONYA about to prep for work as everyone leaves when she looks at her computer one last time. She runs back to it and loads it. It's slow as fuck. When it eventually comes on, she goes to reddit. She has two new messages one from ben-that-niqqa-69 and one from wannabe-davenport-fag-18. She clicks on wannabe-davenport-fag18. It reads: 

You've seen him in the pictures, but have you seen him outside the pictures yet?   
SONYA is a bit confused by this and types: Like in real life. 

Instantly, wannabe-davenport-fag-18 messages back: Yes. If so you don't have long. 

She instantly exits out of reddit, turns off her computer and leaves. 

SONYA
These people are fucking crazy. 

TINA
takes one to know one. 

SONYA
What did you say TINA. 

TINA
Watch it girl, you get too rowdy and i got a gun. 

SONYA leaves. 

scene
SCENE did I just see?

Sonya walks down the subway station stairs and into the crowd of people. She's walking on the subway platform. She leans on a pillar, and closes her eyes. She brethes in and out. She opens her eyes, she sees something in the distance. Farther, down the platform, a man in a suit and a tie with a camera for a head is waving at her. SONYA rubs her eyes as the train arrives. She looks back and the man isn't there.

SONYA laughs as she enters and sit down on the train. 

SONYA
Okay. okay. okay. whew. Okay. 

Sonya gets off the train at her exit. And walks tot he italian restaurant. 

SCENE: Damn, that's a lotta cheese. 

THE ITALIAN RESTAURANT

SONYA enters to a MARIo sitting down.

MARIO
Usualy chief? 

SONYA
Yessir. 

MARIO seats her. 

SONYA

MARIo
Hey, it's okay man. It's chill. I know you don't mean any harm. It's just. 

SONYA
what? 

MARIO
I just read up about it and it seems a bit ridiculous ya know. A man with a camera for a head? 

SONya
Yeah, it is... strange. 

CAMERAMAN
But if you're seeing the pictures move, you should worry, my dear. 

SONYA looks up at MARIO

SONYA
what did you say? 

MARIO
I asked if you're still... seeing the... pictures move. 

SONYA
No... I'm not. I was just joking. 

MARIO
Sure. 

He goes to get her food and wine. He pops the cork and pour her wine. She pulls out a small book and starts reading as he pulls out the parmesean grater. 

MARIO
Extra cheese? 

SONYA
Yes please, 

MARIO
Just say when. 

MARIO grates the cheese as she reads her book. 

MArio
Say When.

Mario continues to grate as she reads. 

MArio
SAY when. 

MArio contineus to grate as sandra begins to shut her book when she looks up at CAMERAMAN gratting cheese. 

CAMERAMAN
Say Cheese. 

SONYA falls to the floor, screaming. 

MARio
whoa, whoa, Sonya, are you alright? 

SONYA
he was, he was. 

MARIO
He, He who? 

SONYA
CAMERAMAN. He was fucking grating cheese. 

MARIO
Sonya, I was grating your cheese, I have always grated your cheese. 

SONYA
no no no no no it was him, it was CAmeraman, he had on a little suit and he had this big camera for a head and he just-, 

MARIO
SONYA, no one else was here. 

SONYA looks around as to see the staff in the kitchen, scared of her, staring. She runs out the restaurant. 

SCENE HE TRIED IT

Early morning office. SONYA is outside of the building, waiting. TINA and ROBBIE walk up and see her. 

TINA
Oh hell, this can't be good. 

ROBBIE

Tina
Negro, we are a nonprofit.

ROBBIE

TINA
Hey sonya, how's ity going. 

SONYA

TINA
Oh, well, y'all don't really start work til 9 and all of y'all are always late as hell. 

SONYA
Oh well-.

TINA
I don't care. 

Tina unlocks the doors and let's SONYA in. She runs to her computer. 

ROBBIE
I ain't never seen that girl run. Nowhere. It looks freaky. 

TINA
I think it's because of her gait. 

ROBBIE
She gay? I thought she was just trans. 

TINA
HEr gait. the way sh walks. 

ROBBIE
that's what you get for using special words. You're misunderstood by the illiterates. And we outnumber you. 

TINA bet you couldn't even spell that number. 

ROBBIE 
Could you?? 

SONYA loads her computer and waits impatiently. As soon as it loads she runs to reddit to message wannabe-davenport-fag-18: 

Okay okay okay what the fuck I saw him twice, I saw hiim TWICEEEEEE WHAT THE FUCK AM I GONNA DIE?

Everyone has started to roll in the office. 

JANET
Hey Sonya, cutie in the closet, and that's not a pun, he's totally straight, Jason ordered us breakfast! Apparently a dispute with ubereats finally got clsoed and he spent it on us. How sweet? 

She makes an american hand heart to JASON. He throws her back a korean heart.   

SONYA
What? Why do I have to get it? 

JANET
WHy can't you? are you busy? 

SONYA
Are you? 

JANET
If you don't get the damn donuts. 

SONYA goes to the door to get the breakfast order. 

The courier is holding the box for her. 

COURIER
Are you Janet. 

SONYA
NO, but the lazy lady sent me. 

COURIER
Yeah, I hate my boss too. 

SONYA goes to grab the food when she hears. 

CAMERAMA
I hate a bad picture too. 

SONYA Looks up to see CAMERAMAN, holding the boxes. She punches him in the Lens and starts choking him, they fall to the ground. ROBBIE and TINA come over to stop the fight, Pulling SONYA off of CAMERAMAN. 

SONYA
He's trying to kill me! He's trying to kill me. 

TINA
Girl, what the fuck, you attacked him. 

SONYA
I had to fucking get him first. 

ROBBIE
You got beef with the courier? Y'all seemed cool at first.

SONYA
The what? 

The courier is sitting on the ground, covered in donuts and coffee.

SONYA
No, but it was camera man. 

JANET (OS)
that doesn't sound like donut's being deli-, 

JANET, JEREMY, JASON and other office workers come to see the commotion. 

JEREMY
Oh my god. What happened. 

SONYA
It was Cameraman. 

JEREMY
Oh my-,

SONYA
I swear he was here. 

TINA
I ain't seen no man with no camera for a head. 

SONYA
He was right here. 

The courier stands up with a camera on a landyard around him. 

SONYA
Why the fuck do you have a camera. 

COURIER
I like taking pictures of sidewalks. 

JASON
What? 

COURIER
I have an instagram account, walk_on_this_side. it's like a archival project. it's like that dude who likes to take pictures of alleys, or the guy who takes pictures of doors, but it's like more... like a combination on uniformity and how individual still creeps in due to time, lack of repair and bureacratic systems-, 

JANET
Look Kid, you're getting on my nerves, you need to leave. I hate artists. 

SONYA
You hate artists? 

JANET 
THIS ISN"T ABOUT ME RIGHT NOW. 

SONYA looks around as every stares at her. 

SCENE SABBATICAL

SONYA sits in an office chair. The Boss,TINA, Jeremy, JANET, and the COURIER are on the other side. The courier is eating a donut. 

THE BOSS
So, again-, 

SONYA
yes so-, 

THE BOSS
A man... with a camera for a head instantly appeared to you where the courier just was, to kill you. 

SONYA
Yes. 

THE BOSS
I don't see you dead. 

SONYA
well, I had to defend myself, he was going to attack-, 

THE BOSS turns his computer monitor around to replay footage. SONYA punches The COURIER in the face and continues to beat him as he flails back and falls. 

THE BOSS
You really woulda been something in the ring. 

HE can't take his eyes off it. 

THE BOSS 
My bets would always be on you. 

JANET
Wait, replay that-, 

THE BOSS
Oh this one? 

He replays the punch. 

THE BOSS
Just think about it. You put four dollars in, you're at least getting four dollars back with this one. But, Sonya, even though you've got a great left hook, this really... isn't... the place for that... You know we have a zero tolerance policy for violence in this building. 

SONYA
No, i know I know, and I'm sorry I just. 

THE BOSS
Sonya, sweetheart, you know what this means? 

THE COURIER makes a noise sipping from his straw. 

THE COURIER
Do we have anymore coffee left? 

SONYA
why the fuck is he here? 

THE BOSS
Behave, you better be lucky he doesn't sue us. 

THE COURIER
It's cool. It's chill. I'm used to people hallucinating and punching me. My grandpa has dementia. 

The room moans in agreement and consolation. 

SONYA
Doesn't he have fucking things to deliver. 

THE COURIER
Well, I actually do this part tiem, and you were the last one of the day, so I'm actually really free from now on. 

THE BOSS
Do you program? 

SONYA
Wait wait wait, look. I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry okay. I've just. Lately I haven't been sleeping a lot, and I think it's just alck of sleep, Ya know. Like I haven't been getting enough good sleep, and when you don't get enough good sleep, you can start to have mild hallucinations and the can go from mild to wild depending about how long you've been getting little sleep. 

THE BOSS
Look. Look. I hate when people beg and explain themselves, it's really depressing to me. I'm not going to kill you. I'm just going to suggest you take a-, 

He Looks at JANET. 

JANET
Sabbatical. 

THE BOSS
YEah, a sabbatical. Take some time, Take a break, get some sleep. And rest.

SONYA
Well, for how long. 

The room is quiet. 

SONYA
For how long? 

THE BOSS
I fear that's a conversation for later, when we see some progress? Hmm? I think that's a fair better deal than losing your job and getting charges pressed for assault? 

SONYA is quiet. and stares on as they look at her. 

THE COURIER
But do we have anymore coffee? 

JANET
OKAY, get him out of here. He's still an artists and I hate art. 

THE COurier
You Hate Art? 

JANET
Too whimsical. 

THE BOSS

EVERYONE leaves the room as SONYA walks back to her cubicle. 

TINA
AYE AYE AYE what are you doing?

SONYA
I was just gettign some things from my desk.

TINA
and then leave, immediately. 

SONYA runs to her desk and moves things around with one hand while trying to log into reddit. She see's a message from wannabe-davenport-fag-18 when she is ripped away by TINA. 

TINA
You need to leave. 

SONYA 
NO!

SOnya crawls back to the desk and tries to grab the mess when she is pulled away. Tina throws SONYA onto the street. 

TINA
Get some help girl.

SONYA
I mean, you were at their beck and call. 

TONY

SONYA

TONY

tony hangs up. 

SONYA
Hello. HEllo??

SCENE Gotta Find a Phone 2

SONYA is at another brownstone, the sky is growing darker. SONYA rings the doorbell. A Older, sophisticated woman, SOPHIA, answers the door. 

SOPHIA

SOPHIA

SONYA
You know you always look good. 

SOPHIA

SOPHIA

SOPHIA
A shame. So I get the conspiracy theories and cops coming to my house, and you get the nice quiet life?

SONYA
SOPHIE I just-,

SOPHIA
It doesn't matter, you looked happier then. 

SONYA
What? 

SOPHIA
You look sad, bitch. 

SOPHIA closes the door on her. 

SONYA
WHat the fuck, SOPHIA? 

SOphia opens the door with a broom sweeping at her. 

SONYA
I will not be the lady with someone yelling on her doorstep. Get. GET. 

scene GOTTA FIND A PHONE 3

the sky is black now as sonya walks down a busy street and turns into a dive bar. MARCO is serving beer to a slow crowd. 

SONYA
COCO-,

MArco looks at sonya and turns the other way. 

SONYA
Wait, wait.

Marco
What do you want? 

SONYA
I wanna talk.

MARCO
I'm kinda busy right now. 

SONYA looks at the empty bar. 

MARCO
I help customers. 

Sonya Puts a twenty on the table. 

SONYA
Moscow Mule... Who's the capitalist now?

MARCO
The lady with the fucking office job. 

SONYA
She could still be a revolutionary. 

MARCO
What revolution happens in an office. 

SONYA
Quiet ones. MEaningful ones. 

MARCO
And you're leading them?

SHE's quiet. 

MARCO and you told me never to talk to you again, so I should honestly obey your wishes. 

MARCO goes back to doing his work. 

SONYA
okay marco. 

He doesn't turn around. 

SONYA
You're not, really-, 

MARCO leaves the bar to go to the kitchen. 

SONYA
MARCO! MARCO?

She gets up go to into the kitchen when a big beefy guy, MORELLO, steps out. 

SONYA
Hey MOMO. 

MOMO stands, arms crossed. 

SONYA
MOMO. 

MOMO
He don't wanna talk SONYA. And I thought you were done with us. Your words. 

He turns around. 

CUSTOMER
Oh, you must've beena bitch, they let everybody back there. 

He walks back there. 

MOMO
Who tf is he? 

MARCO
I don't know but he's chill. 

SOnya rolls her eyes. SONYA gets an idea in her head.

She walks to the library, which is closed. 

SONYA
FUCK. FUCK. 

She sees a phone store close by. 

SONYA
FUCK. 

SONYA walks towards the phone store. 

SCENE SMART PHONE

SONYA Walks into the phone store, the PHONE ATTENDANT is scrolling on his phone. 
PHONE ATTENDANT
Hi There, how can I help you? 

SONYA
I'd like to purchase, a phone. 

PHONE ATTENDANT
Yeah, okay, that's definitely what we do here. Um-, Do you know what kind of phoen you-, 

SONYA
Smart.

PHONE ATTENDANT
Yes, I mean, we can definitely, do that too. But that doesn't give me a distinction. Like... Do you want to get an iphone or an android? Huawei? 

SONYA
Just the cheapest phone that can get me on reddit!

PHONE ATTENDANT looks at her and laughs. 

SONYA
it's not funny i could die!

PHONE ATTENDANT
Social media addiction is real, you're right. 

SONYA
What, no that's. Have you heard about the CAMERAMAN? 

The PHONE ATTENDANT looks at her. 

PHONE ATTENDANT 
I'm just gonna get you the cheapest phone we have. it's 70$. 

SONYA
seventy dollars????

SONYA Checks her wallet, she only has 10$. 

PHONE ATTENDANT
Well, I did say that, so yes. 

SONYA
Give me like, 20 minutes. 

PHONE ATTENDANT
We close in 30. 

SONYA
Okay. I'll be back. 

SONYA runs out the store. She runs down the street, weaving in and out of people. She comes to a street and stalls. She turns left and runs down a hill and and takes a right. She runs through an alley way and hops some fences. She runs through a park and then cuts through a backyard. She comes around the corner and she's at her apartment. She runs in, takes off her shoes, goes to her closet and pulls out a safe. She breaks through and inside is stacks of cash and money. She grabs a few dollars and shoves them in her pockets. She thinks and grabs a few more. And then a few more. She runs and puts her shoes on and runs out the door. She's running Through the park, then over the fence, then up the hill. She dings back into the store. 

PHONE ATTENDANT
OH My Gosh, that was so quick. 

SONYA is breathing extremely hard. The PHONE ATTENDANT shows her his phone, a timer is running at 12 minutes and 39 seconds. 

PHONE ATTENDANT 
IDk where you live, but if you said 20 and it took you twelve for there and back, you should like really sign up for some runs, you could get a medal.

SONYA
Please, A phone. 

PHONE ATTENDANT
You sure you don't wanna wait a minute, catch your breath? 

SONYA pulls out a wad of cash and hands it to the PHONE ATTENDANT, who takes it. 
PHONE ATTENDANT
This covers the phone and the phone plan. 

SONYA
Phone plan? 

PHONE ATTENDANT
Yeah, the phone is practically useless without a phone plan. you need that to access the internet to get on reddit. Unless you have wifi at home. 

The PHONE ATTENDANT looks her up and down. 

PHONE ATTENDANT
if you don't have a phone, you definitely don't have wifi. 

SONYA
Whatever, just, just do it please. 

The PHONE ATTENDNT goes behind the counter. They select a phone and type on their computer. 

PHONE ATTENDANT
So, what plan would you-, 

SONYA
Medium, Meidum, the plan in the middle. 

PHONE ATTENDANT
The middle plan? 

SONYA
Not too cheap, not too expensive. I don't know! Just do it. 

The PHONE ATTENDANT stares at her and continues typing. He Hands her the box. the phone came in and her phone. 

PHONE ATTENDANT
I set it up for you, I feel like you'd need it. 

SONYA
Honestly thank you. 

PHONE ATTENDANT has the rest of the money in their hands. SONYA runs out with her phoen as she types on it. The PHONE ATTENDANT shrugs and counts the money. 

PHONE ATTENDANT
Oh... I'm eating good tonight. 

Outside, sonya logs into reddit and sees the messages. She taps onto wannabe-davenport-fag-18: 

look, I think if we can meet up maybe I can help? I saw you're tag and we're both in NYC, how soon can you get to a bar at the corner of marks and lefferts? 
hello? 
oh fuck please don't tell me you died. 
please? 

SONYA taps back:

I'm on my way now. I can be there in 30. 

Wannabe-davenport-fag-18 taps back quickly:
I'll be there in 10. 

SCENE Meet up

SONYA is in front of the bar, checking her phone to ensure it's the right one. She goes inside and surveils the bar. She surveils the environment, trying to figure out which one is her pen pal. SONYA goes up to one man? 

SONYA
Are you wannabe-davenport-fag-18?

MAN1
Did you just call me a fag? 

SOnya runs from him and goes to another.

SONYA
Are you wannabe-davenport-fag-18?

MAN2
I am a fag but I ain't no wanna be? 

SONYA is about to talk to another guy before someone comes up to them.

JOSHUA
We probably should've exchanged names to make this easier. I'm JOSHUA, or Josh.  

SONYA
Thank you, I'm Sonya.  I don't think I could keep embarrassing myself. 

JOSHUA
I mean, the situation is pretty embarrassing, given we're seeing a man with a camera for a head, ya know? You want a drink first? 

SONYA
Honestly, please? Moscow Mule. 

JOSHUA
Cool, I'll come find you. 

SONYA goes to a booth at the back of the bar while JOSH goes to the bar. SONYA sits and looks around for a bit. 

JOSHUA
Here ya go. 

He puts two shots down along with her drink and his. 

SONYA
Shots. 

JOSHUA
I think you're gonna want it. 

SONYA
I usually don't take drinks from strange men. 

JOSHUA
Don't worry, I have no access to rohypnol and I honestly don't see the point in date raping people. It's so weak and a waste of time and resources. But if you don't want it I will definitely. 

He goes to reach for it but SONYA picks it up. 

SONYA
To survival. 

JOSHUA Picks up his and clinks it to her's. 

JOSHUA
To survival. 

As they cheer SONYA looks away as JOSHUA stares at her. 

JOSHUA
Wait, what the fuck, why did you look away when we cheered? 

SONYA
Um, why would I stare at you? 

JOSHUA
It's bad luck to not look into the eyes of someone your cheersing. 

SONYA
You believe in that stuff. 

JOSHUA
A man with a camera for a head is hunting us. Who knows what's the truth out there. 

SONYA Thinks for a second. 

SONYA
Holy shit, am I gonna die now. 

JOSHUA
Okay, let's not do that. There's no point. I think you can survive. I did, well. 
SONYA
Okay, How did you get away? How are you still alive? 

JOSHUA
okay, before we get into that, what do you know? 

SONYA
This started round two years ago after the pandemic "closed" or whatever the fuck that means. People started going missing, only a polaroid picture is uploaded and everythign else is deleted, #saycheese? I mean, what the fuck. 

JOSHUA
How much have you seen? 

SONYA
the pictures play like videos now. 

JOSHUA
Fuck, you're really far along. 

SONYA
You don't see them. 

JOSHUA
WHen CAMERON's picture dropped, I saw it play out in that very moment. Her Running away. the film capturing her and dragging her. CAMERAMAN walking into the frame. 

SONYA
I thought you said if you saw them he get's you. I thoguht you said you got away, I'm so confused. 

JOSHUA
It doesn't really make sense to me, too. So, me and my bestfriend Paul-, 

SONYA
Wait, paul duncan. He went missing six months ago?

JOSHUA
I was there when it happened. 

SONYA
Please, explain something. Give me something, you're not giving me any details. 

JOSHUA
So, my friend was chronically online. He was always on reddit and shit. He's into true crime nad lore, so when this camera man shit popped out, he was a fanatic. I was never really into that stuff, I don't even watch horror movies. 

SONYA
Really?

JOSHUA
Too scary? 

SONYA
You baby. 

JOSHUA
I'm very baby. I'll cry and shit on myself if I'm upset. 

SONYA
Oh, I-, 

JOSHUA
IBS and really bad anxiety. 

SONYA
Ugh, what a twofer. 

JOSHUA
SO, I stay away from shit that keeps me crazy. But he decided to show me one day when we were hanging out after work. 

Flashback: 

JOSHUA and PAUL are laying under blankets, Joshua reading a book and PAUL scrolling on his phone. PAUL looks at JOSHUA. 

PAUL
Joshie. 

JOSH
That tone of voice means nothing good. 

PAUL
Just check it out. 

JOSH
I'm not looking at that CAMERAMAN shit. That's so macabre. That's someone's last moments. 

PAUL
And isn't it so fascinating. There's even a psychosis of people seeing the pictures move. 

JOSH
Allegedly. No one has ever come out publicly and said they've seen it. 

PAUL
Would you? that's a one way ticket to people always doubting what you say. People love degrading people they don't believe. 

JOSH
I mean, it sounds crazy. 

PAUL
UGH I just wanna see if you'll see it move. 

JOSH rolls his eyes and snatches the phone. The picture doesn't move. 

JOSH
It didn't do shit. 

PAUl Grabs the phone and looks at it with him. The picture of the OTESS girl is stark and haunting. She is in the forest, the night is dark and stormy. Her eyes are wet and welling to the brim. 

PAUL
Yeah, it didn't move for me ei-, 

That instant, in the pciture of the OTess girl, a tear falls down her left cheek. 

PAUL
HOLY FUCK, DID YOU- did you? 

JOSH
No, hehe, no. No. Paul. 

PAUl
She cried. You saw a tear, I saw a tear. 

FLASHBACK END 

SONYA
Wait... You saw it at the same time? 

JOSh
And only at the same time. 

SONYA
What? 

FLASHBACK

PAUL takes the phone from josh and looks at it. 

PAUL
It's not... it's not. She's crying it's back to.

JOSH Grabs the phone, too. The Picture doesn't move. 

JOSH
I told you, group psychosis. 

PAUL
Wait, just look at it with me for a sec. 

JOSH
Why, it's fucking stupid-, 

PAUl
Just, please. 

JOSH relents and looks at it with PAUL. She cries again, and now, she mouthes the words, "please."

PAUL
Ho lee FUck. 

JOSH
It's playing, constantly, Like a bad gif. 

PAUL
No, wait, see, it's getting longer. 

Together they watch as the sequence grows from her crying to her begging, to a bright light beginning to shine on her.

FLASH BACK END

SONYA
You guys didn't.

JOSH
We were stupid, we watched it all night until she died. WOrst decision of our lives. The next day, Paul and I went thrifting. And this one thrift store usually has camera's that paul and I like to pick at. 

FLASHBACK

PAUL
Do you ever think that we could resell these at some point? 

JOSH
Shit, like on depop? Would anybody buy this trash? 

CAMERAMAN
One man's trash is another man's treasured tool, but a phillistine wouldn't understand. 

JOSH
Good oen paul. Nice voices. 

JOSH Looks to PAUL, who is pale and sweaty. 

PAUL
That wasn't, that wasn't me. 

THey Both look back and scream to see CAMERAMAN. An old woman stands there. Customers and another worker walks up.  

OLD WOMAN
No one has appreciation for the old things these days. 

They Both run away. 

OLD WOMAN
See, they hate me. They hate old people. This is why we fucked the markets.

FLASH BACK END


SONYA
Wait, so he started getting you guys, together. 

JOSH
It didn't help. We were best friends. Roommates. Brothers almost. I loved that man. 

SONYA
Loved. I don't like the past tense of that. 

JOSH 
As you can guess, and experienced, we started seeing him more and more outside. It got to the point, where we started attacking people. 

SONYA
Because you thought they were him. 

JOSH
And not just that, he kept getting closer. Inescapable almost. I wanted to run, but PAUL wanted to face him. So, He set up a plan.

FLASHBACK

PAUL is in his backyard, setting up cameras of all kidns around him. JOSH watches from a window close by. 

JOSH
Paul we really shouldn't.

PAUL
I'm fucking tired of this. I'm gonna fucking kill him. 

JOSH
Paul, how are you going to? 

PAUL pulls out a knife. 

PAUL
Look, we're out of options. Priests didn't know what to do. The psychic doesn't know what's up. I'm tired and I'm not running. You can if you want. 

JOSH
I don't wanna leave you man. 

PAUL 
Just stay behind the door. If you're farther away, you can at least try to help. 
PAUL hands him a lighter and hairspray. 

PAUL
FILM melts easily with fire. 

PAUL shuts the door, while Josh watches from the window. PAUl Sits in the circle, calling for CAMERAMAN. 

FLASHBACK END

SONYA
What happened? 

JOSH
I was nervous. I dropped the can, it rolled away.

FLASHBACK
Josh drops the can and they keep kicking it away from them. When they get it while it's halfway across the room, there is  a flash behind them, coming frmo outside. Josh runs to the see PAUL take a swipe at CAMERAMAN, who grabs his arm and makes him drop the knife. JOSH runs through the doors, closer to his friend, who is now snared in film around his face, shoulders and arms. As the film grows, JOSHUA tries to rip it off of his friend, but it keeps crawling on a screaming PAUL. JOSHUA pulls presses the cannister and lights the fire. The film makes a shrill scream as JOSH scratches at the film hole, but it wraps around him more. as it crawls upon his arms, JOSH Has to pull away and rip off the film from himself, as it begins to drag him in. he can only watch as his friend suffers. 

FLASHBACK END

SONYA
Oh my god... i'm so sorry.

JOSH
It's not your fault. 

SONYA
What the fuck is this thing?

JOSH
Some people think it's a ghost, but more; some people have an idea it's some group summoning because of our dependence on the phone camera and appearance through the lens, that's a bit crazy for me because group summon, how are we responsible; some people are like calling it like an american yokai or whatever, which doesn't make anysense because wouldn't that just be a cryptid, aren't our yokais cryptids?

SONYA
Eh, i think yokais have more to do with spirits where cryptids are more an evolutionary thing, I'm thinking. COuld he be a cryptid? 

JOSH
What, we evolved from cameras. 

SONYA
Oh we become the machine, like what we are about to become, like transhumanism. 

MAN1
What the fuck are you two talking about? 

SONYA
Um, This is a private conversation. 

MAN2
I don't know, you're being kinda loud, like tou want us to hear. It's very performative, the fear. 

MAN1 pulls out his phone. 

JOSH
What the fuck is happening right now. 

MAN1
Yeah, I got a 51/50, I got two crazies here talking about transhumanism, morphing into cameras, some shit. Yeah, they're black. 

JOSh
What the fuck? 

SONYA
I don't think that's how a 51/50 works...

MAN1
Stay around, to find out. 

SONYA
Um...

JOSH
My car is around the corner. 

JOSH walks out the bar while SONYA leaves a pile of cash on the table. 

SONYA (to MAN1 and MAN2) 
Don't fucking steal it. 

SONYA walks off. MAN1 watches the money lustfully as MAN2 creeps in, slowly trying to grab a dollar. SONYA comes in and slaps his hand. 

MAN2
Assault from a crazy bitch, the cops will like that. 

SONYA runs out of the shop as JOSH pulls up. SONYA hops in and they pull off. 

SCENE You're not that crazy

NIGht- Sonya's apartment building entrance. MARIO is outside, on his phone. 

SONYA
Mario? What's going on? 

MARIO
Oh, thank god. I'm glad you're okay. 

SONYA
Oh, thank you? 

MARIO
I was worried about you. I finished work a little bit ago and thought I'd check in. You didn't answer the door so i was, starting to get a little worried. 

MARIO Looks at JOSH. 

MARIO
I'm MARIO, Nice to meet you dude. 

JOSH
Yeah, man, it's good to meet you too. 

MARIO
How do you guys know each other? 

SONYA and JOSH look at each other. 

SONYA
Uh-It's actually kinda of funny a bit. 

JOSH
Yeah, um. We used to play, tennis. 

SONYA
Table tennis, ya know. Ping pong. 

JOSH
Like Marty MCfly

SONYA
Timothee Chalamet

JOSH
Ya'know, Schweppes, aye now chop. 

HE does the dance. It's awkward as hell. 

MARIO
You guys are really bad at lying. 

JOSH
Well it's either lie or sound crazy. 

MARIO
Is it about the CAMERAMAN. 

SONYA
why, have you been seeing it?  

MARIO
I still don't see that shit, but like I don't believe people just act out or do shit for no reason. So if you say you saw some shit, I fucking believe you. I wanna help, in anyway I can. 

SONYA
Alright, come up. 

SONYA Unlocks the door as MARIo and JOSH follow in behind. 

SCENE PLAn? 

JOSH, SONYA and MARIO enter her apartment, MARIO stares around. 

MARIO
Oh wow. 

SONYA
What? 

MARIO
It's way more chic than I imagine. 

JOSH
Yeah, it's simple, but tasteful. 

SONYA
Let's not make this an HGTV show, so, we have some man-, 

JOSH
With a camera for a head who kills-, 

MARIO
following you guys. What's the sequence anyway? 

SONYA
Sequence. 

MARIO
Like, how do you see him, i'm wondering? 

JOSh
I never really thought about if there was a pattern. 

SONYA
I always see him when there's a camera around. 

MARIO
Okay, so he uses cameras to basically hop from place to place. 

JOSh
Like Minato, from naruto, and the flying god technique. 

MARIO
You fucking weeb, you sound like my cousin. 

SONYA
Ugh, you anime niggas, always gotta reference those cartoons. Is now the time, really? 

JOSH
It was a reference. To make it make more sense. 

SONYA
None of this shit makes sense in the first fucking place. Nobody fucking gets that. 

JOSH
But maybe, ya know, if you watch anime. 

MARIO
Dude, nobody's gonna fucking get that. It's like, know your crowd. 

JOSH
Well, I-. Okay whatever. Camera's are bad. 

MARIO
I mean, it makes sense. Are you guys the only ones that are like, seeing it? 

JOSh
SONYA is the only person I've reached out to who is like seeing things. 

SONYA
I actually got a message from someone else. 

JOSH
Really? 

Sonya types on her phone and shows the messages. 

MARIO
big brother, like the tv show?

JOSH
Oh god, this dude sounds a bit out there. Did you find out where he was? 

SONYA types on her phone. 

SONYA
Now, all we do is wait for him to respond. I hope it's not too far. Like conneticut or something. 

MARIO
What do we do, while we wait? 

SONYA
I mean.... I don't have a tv. 

JOSH
The phone is the new tv girl. and you've got one. 

They're on the couch, eating some snacks, laughing at videos when SONYA goes to the window and checks her phone. 

SONYA
It's been like an hour and he hasn't responded. 

JOSH
I mean, it is pretty late. We gotta give him time. 

MARIO
HOw much time do we have? 

SONYA looks outside. MAN1 and MAN2 are pointing with a cop up at her apartment. 

SONYA
Oh my god. 

JOSH and MARIO come to the window. 

JOSh 
CAMERAMAN? 

SONYA
No, the gays from the bar. 

MARIO
What the, why are they here? 

JOSH
i did not know a civilian can call a 51/50? 

SONYA
This is ridiculous, I bet they're not even healthcare professionals. 

JOSH
Do you know a way out of here? 

SONYA
I mean, yes. 

MARIO
let's go, now. 

SONYA Looks down and police officers are entering her building. 

SONYA
okay, go go. 

They leave her apartment and race down the back stairway. They sneak past the cops and out the backdoor, over some fences. They go aroudn the corner to JOSH's car, a block away from the police. They drive away. 

SCENE: JERSEY?????

They drive around the city. 

JOSH
He still hasn't-, 

SONYA
At this point, it's ridiculous. I think we should just give up. 

MARIO
Do you think he got him. CAMERAMAN? 

SONYA checks his reddit, he still has pictures of himself on there, smoking from a bong rip. 

SONYA
His weed selfies are still up there. 

SONYA
Okay, I just dont understand why. 

Her messages show a new one. 

SONYA
Wait, he got back to me. 

HIs message reads;
Yeah, I live with my mom in jersey #BERGENBOY.

SONYA
Oh god?

JOSH
He's in conneticut? 

SONYA
Worse, JErsey. 

They car groans. 

JOSh
Get an address from him and I guess we'll make our way to hell. 

MARIO
America's armpit. 

They ride through various neighborhoods and happen upon a modest house. 

SONYA
I have a bad feeling about this. 

JOSH
Has he messaged you back? 

SONYA
No, and it's been 40 fucking minutes. 

MARIO
Do you think CAMERAMAN got him? 

JOSh
DUde, you gotta stop asking that. 

MARIO
It makes sense to ask it, it's part of the circumstances. 

SONYA
Ugh, let's just get this over with. 

They get out of the car and walk towards the front door. They walk to the front door past the garage. 

JOSH
So do we just ring the doorbell. 

MARIO presses it relentlessly. JOSH stops him. 

JOSH
Jesus Christ man, we don't wanna annoy him. 

At that point, the garage door slowly opens, a shit ton of smoke comes from it. 

SONYA
Oh My God. 

MARIO
I like this dude. 

JOSh
TOo much smoke for one person. 

MALCOLM (29) comes out from the smoke of the garage holding a bong. 

MALCOLM
I got her nice and cherried for y'all. 

MARIO goes forward and grabs the bong. JOSh and SONYA follow. 

SCENE: It's all a scam. 

They are surrounded by boxes and trash, and trashbags. 

MALCOLM
Take a seat anywhere!

SONYA and JOSH look at the boxes while MARIO takes a huge hit of the bong. 

MALCOLM
Nice pull man. So, you guys have been seeing the photo stuff. 

MARIo
not me, just them. 

MALCOLM
ahh, you are unaffected by the frequency. 

JOSH
The Frequency? 

SONYA
Wait, wait wait, CAMERAMAN has a frequency? 

MALCOLM
It's all frequencies. And the water. 

JOSH
The water? 

MARIO
Um. 

MALCOLM
Well, the flouride. They think it blocks psychic powers but it actually numbs your connection to reality and makes you hallucinate, well that and the other cocktail of chemicals that they put into the tap and bottled water.

THEy stare at him. 

MALCOLM
Yeah, it's all poisoned, that's why you gotta get your water straight from the stream. But they still got me. I blame the coffee at work. They're still using tap water. 

JOSh
Okay man, I'll bite, 

SONYA
Please don't let's, 

JOSH
What exactly does water have to do withthe frequency. 

MALCOLM
I'm glad you've said that my friend. Basically, everything we see is an amalgamation of molecules vibrating at different speeds, I mean, that's how we get the different states of matter. But those things, are just vibrating. They are vibrations. So, if you can affect the perceptions of vibrations, you can basically affect what the mind sees. Weaken the mind, attune it to the appropriate frequency, and then implant whatever images you want. 

SONYA looks at JOSH. 

MARIO
I didn't know this was some big government conspiracy. 

MALCOLM
They never want you to think that man. They always want you to think it's some ghost, or maybe like something else but it's all the government. The government is the ghost in the system! They are the haunt that we must exorcise. 

JOSH
Okay... but CAMERAMAN... HOw is he releated to this?

MALCOLM
Cover upthe kidnappings for uman expiermentation. 

SONYA
ooh my god. 

MALCOLM
No seriously, think about it. People go missing, nothing but a picture. And we can't find their bodies? I think the government sends out frequencies, and who ever attunes to them meets the criteria for experimentation. 

SONYA
What experiments? 

MALCOLM
Have you ever seen stranger things? 

SONYA
I can't- I can't- I can't do this, I can't do this. 

MALCOLM Walks over to a box. 

MALCOLM
It's okay-It's okay. Look. I have just the thing, that'll help us. 

He pulls out tin foil hats. He gives one to SONYA, and then another to MARIO, and then FINALLy one to JOSH. 

MALCOLM
These, will be our salvation from the coming ogverment mind control through their camera lden observation. The panopticon is on our phones, but also within our walls and waters. 

JOSh
The water surveils? (to SONYA) Hey, Um, I think I gotta... feed my cat. 

MALCOLM
CAT? Oh, don't get me started on those sorry excuse for aliens. 

SONYA
Cats are aliens? 

MALCOLM
Every single one of them, have you looked into their fucking eyes? 

JOSH
Yeah, I'm warming up the car. 

JOSH leaves the house and goes to the car while SONYA waits for MARIO to finish smoking weed. 

MALCOLM
Wait, don't forget your helmets guys. 

SONYA
I think it's too small, I'mm sorry. i don't want to waste the helmet. 

SCENE- Let's go. 

They all slam into the car.

MARIO
That was-,

JOSH
I don't wanna talk it about it, I just wanna go. 

They Drive OFF as malcolm watches.

MALCOLM
They have fucking fed energy anyway. 

MALCOLm goes to sit and smoke some more. He goes to his computer to watch something. He hears something move and knock over, which he goes to check out. He does see anything When CAMERAMAN appears behind him. 

CAMERAMAN
Ready for your close up, I see. 

MALCOLM
What the fuck. 

CAMERAMAN
I could say the same thing about you. 

MALCOLM
Fucking Fed. 

CAMERAMAn
Oh BOy. 

MALCOLM
Oh my God, how did you guys find me?

CAMERAMAN
I think it's easy to, consider the trail you leave. 

MALCOLM is quiet. 

CAMERMAN
Oh, you're a naughty little boy. A nasty little man are you. SO worried about the government, when everyone else should be worried about you and what you do with the sanctitity of videos, of photos, of camera, of the power to capture human essence from the physical to the visual. You put people in precarious situations against their will to receive a modicum of pleasure. You are the ghost with the machine, always trying to get inside the human biomechanisms. YOu are just as muhc of a curse to this world as you think you aren't. And you are going to be fun to kill. But First. 

THE CAMERAMAN snaps a picture of MALCOLM. 

CAMERAMAN
But I've seen the material, I doub't it'll be perfect.  

SCENE FUCK

INT- Car- NIght

JOSH is turning to drive outside the neigthborhood when MARIO feels his pants. 

MARIO
Fuuuuuuck, guys...I forgot my phone. 

JOSH
You didn't. 

SONYA
This is the opposite of helpful MARIO. 

MARIO
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it was just some good ass weed, and then he was saying all that stuff, I mean like don't make me feel bad, the high is so good. 

JOSH
Ugh, just get in and get out. 

JOSh pulls up to MALCOLM's house. MARIO opens the door when they hear a faint yell. SONYA and JOSH look at each other. They all run out of the car towards the Garage door. They can hear malcolm screaming and bones crunching. JOSH Tries to get the garage door open, SONYA and MARIO join him. As MALCOLM's screams reach a fever pitch, they spring the garage door open to find malcolm's clothes, and the bong in a bloody pile. SONYA pulls out her phone to check reddit and sees no other posts from MALCOLM, just one post from him,  in his dirty garage, bewilderment and confusion in his eyes as he's holding the bong. 

SONYA
FUCK. 

She shows it to JOSH. MARIO Looks for his phone and finds it. 

JOSH
We gotta get the fuck outta here. 

MARIO
How did he even find him. I thought cameras were the portal. 

SONYA looks at MALCOLM's computer set up and sees webcam. She taps JOSh and points to it. 

SONYA
I think it's any camera. 

JOSH holds up his phone and throws it, SONYA does the same. They look at MARIO. 

MARIO
I just paid off my last bill. It took like two years. 

SONYA
How about we just drop you back off, at least on the bridge. 

JOSH
And then we gotta head where there are no cameras. 

MARIO
Don't worry about me. I can call my cousins and they can pick me up. 

JOSH
At least let us drop you off somewhere reasonable. And not like...leave you at a murder scene. 

SONYA
Yeah, it does really read well. Latino man at the scene of a white man's disappearance with a pile of blood, it's just like. 

MARIO
Naaaaah true. 

SCENE DROP OFF

EXT- BUST STOP- NIGHT

Josh pulls up to the Seacaucus train station and let's MARIO get out. 

MARIO
I hate this for you guys. 

JOSh
The help is appreciated though. Most people just blow us off. 

MARIO
No reason to. SONYA has been steady and chill for the past few years. I know she's not crazy. Some things some people see and others don't. 

SONYA
I wish I was the one who couldn't see it. Get home safe MARIO. 

MARIO
Be safe. 

Mario watches as they drive off. 

SCENE

EXT- NIGHT- FREEWAY

A car drives speedily through the dark. It turns off an Exit ramp, and onto a country road. 

JOSH (VO)
I'm thinking, we just have to go deep into the forest.

The car weaves along the phone through the forest. 

SONYA (VO)
Makes sense. If cameras are his portal, we take away his portal

JOSH (VO) 
Takes away access to us. 

The car parks on the side of a road. JOSH and SONYA get out of the car and into the dark. They walk deeper into the forest, aimlessly.  

SONYA(VO)
And do we just, stay here? 

JOSH(VO) 
I, I really don't know Sonya. At least. So we can make a plan. Maybe theorize a way to get him. 

SONYA and JOSH walk through the forest, they get mroe and more tired as they cover distance, over mossy rocks, under fallen trees until they find a place to rest. 

JOSH
This should be good. We're like, by car, miles away from anytown, and by foot, we're at least 3 miles away from any sort of main road. From any house. So we can at least rest. 

SONYA looks off into the distance. 

SONYA
Away from any house? 

JOSH
Yeah, we're like deep in the-, 

He looks to where SONYA is looking and sees a bright light shining. 

JOSH
What the fuck. That wasn't-that wasn't-,

SONYA grabs JOSH and pulls him in the opposite direction. As they walk, a far ways before them, a light appears in the distance. 

JOSH 
SONYA wait. 

JOSHUA Points to the light. He pulls her in a different direction. They both walk in the darkness until another light becomes clear to them in the distance. 

SONYA
Are you sure we're not near anyone? 

JOSH
We honestly, should not be. No, we are not. We are not. 

SONYA
How can you be sure, maybe you're wrong, 

JOSH 
Maybe but. 

A light shines from each other their pockets. 

JOSH
What the fuck. 

He pulls his pocket from his phone. SONYA pulls her pocket from her's. She gets a text. It says from CAMERAMAN and reads: 

Find your light. We have a very special picture to take. 

SONYA
FUCK!

JOSH
What's it say? 

SONYA
I think it's him. At the lights. 

JOSH
It can't be him. 

SONYA
And why can't it? We just found our phones in our pockets after throwing them out. I don't think we have much choice. 

JOSH
We can, we can keep running. 

SONYA
But for how long? 

SONYA starts walking towards the light. 

JOSH
SONYA, Wait sonya!. 

SONYA walks into a clearing where the light is brightest. A projector is playing short videos of sonya. 

SONYA
What the fuck? 

CAMERAMAN
You have the mouth of a sailor. but the vision of a dream. 

SONYA
What the fuckk is this man. 

CAMERAMAN
Your last moments. 

JOSH
Who the fuck are you? 

CAMERAMAN
If you really knew, would you even believe it. Now, we've been doing this little chase for a while, but you can't outrun the beat of technology. People like you, people resistant to the change of life, the ebb and flow of progress are halting the world witih your furocious fear-, your luddism will be your-, 

JOSH
Hold up, wait. 

CAMERAMAN
Excuse me? 

JOSH
That's just... that's not waht you told my friend? You said you were getting him for the morbid curioisity with people's undoing that plagues the american conciousness. 

CAMERAMAN looks at him. 

JOSH
No,you were just calling humanity vulture waiting to pick at the next carcass, but now you're talking about luddism.

CAMERAMAN
Wow, a man who pays attention. Very unusual.

JOSH
So what is it? Luddism or american callousness. Why the fuck are you doing it? 

CAMERAMAN
You think asking pointless questions is going to stave off your friend's death. Cute. But one way or another, she's gonna take the fucking picture. Aren't you SONYA. 

JOSH
SONYA, we can still run. 

SONYA
Honestly, why? I just... I'm 30 someething with barely anythign to look forward to. I have a dead end job, I don't have any prospects, I don't have any friends or family who I can connect with. Who's really going to miss me if I leave. 

JOSH
Mario will miss you. And even if no one misses you, anything is better than this. 

SONYA
I don't think running is better. 

CAMERMAN
Attagirl. Now, go and stand in front of the projector. 

JOSH tries to run towards sonya but CAMERAMAn shoots film at his feet, and tripping him. JOSH tries to grab at the film as SONYA stands in position. 

CAMERAMAN
Big Smile. 

SONYA stands defiant. The camera flashes. The polaroid slowly exits. CAMERAMAN waves the photo about. HE Looks at it. 

CAMERAMAN
Good... but not good enough. 

He spits film at her and drags her in. JOSH has ripped the film away and has gotten to his feet to help SONYA as film continues to wrap up her body, dragging her to CAMERMAN. JOSH rips pieces of film away but they start to entangle his arm. 
CAMERAMAN
Deja vu, eh JOSHUA? 

JOSH
Fuck you. 

CAMERAMAN
When will you understand you have no power when it comes to the CAMERA? 

As SONYA scream and screams, JOSh rips away film from her and himself, film crawling up one arm. He Rips it away and falls back. He gets up and tries to figure out how to help but it's just too much. He backs away as SONYA begins to scream and the familiar cracking of bones takes place. 

In the forest, SONYA's body is bent and broken in unimaginable ways, leg hanging by the knee, arm folded at the shoulder, into the rub, he head leaking blood, as she is being pulled halfway into CAMERAMAN's lens. 

Mouth full of his new found friend as she cries, CAMERAMAN turns his head towards JOSH.  

CAMERAMAN
I haven't forgotten about you. 
  
BLACK.
