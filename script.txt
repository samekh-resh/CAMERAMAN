Scene 1: first kill


Night- outside on the street 

A brownstone lit up under a beautiful and bright street lamp. A car pulls up to the streetlight. Out steps CAMERON, a gorgeously stunning influencer slash model. She’s wearing a tight, pink-clad body suit, with beautiful white pumps. She looks very 70’s. 

CAMERON
Ugh, which one is it? 

She goes on her social media, and goes to find the chat. She scrolls through influencer offers and dms to the party dm. She scrolls up to the picture. A boy, DALLAS, is cringely smiling before he begins to step back and scream, the shadow of a man with a big camera for a head coming into view. She checks her page, tons of followers. She goes to the homescreen. The camera icon. 

CAMERON
Another square for the grid wouldn't hurt. I look good as hell. 

She points the camera to herself, and over her shoulder is CameraMan. She screams. 

CAMERMAN (OS)
Beautiful as always. 

CAMERON
You again, creep. 

CAMERAMAN is a dapper, brogue-shoed, suit wearing classy man with a huge, old film camerama on his head. On his lapel is a flower made of film with a film handkerchief.

CAMERAMAN
Yes. Me again. 

CAMERON
Don't you ever get tired of following me. 

CAMERAMAN
Don't you like having followers? Isn't that all you want in your life? To have a bunch of people follow you so you can sell your empty products with their empty promises? Scamming people daily with teas you never drink, because your stomach is naturally flat, or work out programs you don't do, because you don't fucking work out. 

CAMERON
Yeah, i fucking hate sweating. It's bad for my skin. 

CAMERAMAN
Everything seems to be bad for you these days.

CAMERON
Yeah, I can feel this conversation is bad for me. Good bye freak. 

CAMERON walks away as CAMERAMAN watches.

CAMERAMAN
Weren't you going to take your selfie? 

CAMERON continues walking. 

CAMERAMAN
I bet it would've been perfect. 

CAMERON spins around. 

CAMERON
Yeah, because i'm fucking perfect. 

CAMERON spins around bumping into CAMERAMAN, who is holding something outstretched to her. 

CAMERAMAN
Then prove it, Ms. Narcissis. 

CAMERON goes to get her phone from her purse, searching endlessly to find it.

CAMERAMAN (OS)
You think you'd keep better track of this. 

She looks to CAMERAMAN, seeing he has it in his hands. 

CAMERAMAN
Another square for the grid, right? 

She shakily looks at him. Slow, old timey music starts to play.

CAMERON
What the fuck is that? 

CAMERAMAN(OS)
What is what? 
 
CAMERON
That fucking, that fucking ragtime depression era music. 

CAMERMAN
C'mon honey, we both have seen enough horror movies. 

She looks at him. 

CAMERAMAN
I would take it for you, but no one knows your angles like you.

She grabs the phone, shakily to take the picture. 

CAMERMAN
Oh my god, you gotta use the back camera for the perfect selfie. 

She turns the camera around. 

CAMERAMAN
Remember, 0.5 at that angle. 

CAMERON changes the settings up puts the camera up. She takes the pic with flash, immediately dropping the phone and running. 

She tries to run. 

CAMERAMAN (OS)
Camera shy? Now? 

Film reaches out like tentacles and grabs her and pulls her in. She falls and is dragged on the ground, and out of sight, her screams and the sounds of bones cracking. 

A hand reaches to pick up the phone. It's CAMERON's social media account. All of her posts have been wiped and only one post is on there. A hand picks up the phone. It clicks on the photo. CAMERON, sweaty, and distressed, is looking up at the camera. 

CAMERAMAN
And they pay for this shit. 

BLACK. 
CAMERMAN TITLECARD. 

SCENE 2: INTRO

Busy city streets. Early morning. Pigeons sit in Sonya windowsill as she gets ready for work. She dresses in brown and boring beige. She lives modestly, some would even call minimalist. A gas lamp sits on the bedside tables. Candles sit everywhere, some in random states of use. She puts on her clothes and heads out to work. 

----

SONYA walks along the busy street. When going on the metro, SONYA uses card and cash to pay while others simply tap their phones. SONYA reads a book on transit while others scroll on, or simply listen to, their phones. SONYA makes her way to her office building, a beautiful facade with rotating doors. Inside, two people are talking, ROBBIE the doorman and TINA the Guard. In front of them is a metal detector. 


ROBBIE and TINA
Hey SONYA. 

SONYA
Hey Guys. 

They go back to talking, weirdly eyeing SONYA as she sets down her purse and takes off her watch. 

TINA(laughing)
Sonya, you don't have to. 

SONYA
WHy? What's funny? 

ROBBIE
It's not like you have anything on you. 

TINA
Well, it is always the quiet, lonely types who kill. 

SONYA Stares at them. They Stare back. 

ROBBIE
She's just saying, statistically. 

SONYA stares at him. 

TINA
Girl, get out of here. Youre creepy when you give that dead ass look. 

SONYA walks off. 

TINA
Like a fucking corpse. 

ROBBIE
I mean, what else can you expect from someone who doesn't have a-, 

ROBBIE notices SONYA is still there, watching. 

ROBBIE
Ain't you already late for work? Get!

TINA
She always in our damn business. She need to be fixing them damn computers.

ROBBIE
And her damn gut. YOu here her when she shits on that stool. 

TINA
Sounds like she murdering the toilet. 

ROBBIE
OKAY. Lonely, stanky ass. 

---

SONYA walks to her desk, a tiny cubicle. Nothing is on it, it is bare and simple, some files here and there but it is mainly organized. As she is getting ready for work, a muffin slowly rises behind her. Eventually, SONYA turns around to see it. 

SONYA
What the fuck Janet. 

Janet
Thank god you turned around, I didn't know how long I was gonna hold up my hand. 
SONYA
I repeat, Janet. What the fuck? 

Janet
Well, you didn't actually repeat that. You flipped it. Originaly, you said, What the fuck, Janet, But now you're saying, Janet, What the fuck. 

SONYA
It's the same thing. 

JANET
Well, syntactically, it's different. 

SONYA
It means the same thing. 

JANET
Semantically and syntactically, it could but i'm not here to split hairs with you, I can see time has done that enough with you. I'm here to help you. 

SONYA 
Help me?

JANET
Yes. Word around the office is, your booty hole is hotter than the 7th ring of hell due to all your diarrhea. So I just thought it would be the right thing to do. From one girl to the next. 

SONYA
What does us being women have to do with this. 

Janet
All that shitting and backsplash...it's not good for your little lady. 

SONYA
my little lady? 

JANET
Your clam? 

SONYA
CLAM? 

JANET
I thought you'd get a seafood reference because the fish smell. 

SONYA
Fish smell? 

JANET
Taco box?

SONYA
Janet, please stop the torture. 

JANET
Your vagina, poor water splashing in your vagina is unhealthy. 

SONYA
This conversation is an HR violation. 

JANET
I am hr. 

SONYA
I know, which is part of why this is sad. Sonya, you know I don't have a-,

She waves to herself. 

JANET
On yeah, I do forget. As the queers say, you do give fish! Oh remember, the meeting starts in five. 

Janet slinks beneath her cubicle sectioner. SONYA sighs and gathers her papers and leaves for the meeting room. 
------ 
SCENE: FIRST

Muted voices layer in the background as SONYA stares off. People laugh and talk while she is not engaged. it muffles more and more, becoming almost a muted mash-up, a quieted cacophony until someone claps. It's JANET. 

JANET
Ugh, good one Jeremy, you really should stop this accounting stuff and become a comedian. 

JEREMY
Aw, I've really been thinking about it-,

JANET
Seriously. You're bad at math. 

JEREMY
Wait, really, did I mess up-, 

JANET
JUST KIDDING, Since we're telling jokes. Anyway, before I ended the meeting, I just wanted to share something you guys won't believe. It's this new craze. 

Janet gathers them around her and searches on her phone. 

JANET
My son showed it to me the other day, weirdest little trend.

JEREMY
Oh, is this what I think it is. 

JANET
It's like some blue dress gold dress shit.

SONYA
What? 

JANET
Oh, here it is. 

She is on CAMERON's page. It is still just that page, with that one post. 

JANET
Apparently, people have been deleting all their socials, and posting one pictur, and just one caption-, 

She taps the picture and it moves, as if Cameron is slowly turning away. 

SONYA
What the fuck? 

JANET
Hashtag Say Cheese. So weird right? 

SONYA 
did you guys see that? 

JANET and JEREMY groan. 

SONYA
what was that about? 

JEREMY
Here we go. 

JANET
What? You see anything? 

SONYA
Why are you saying it like that? 

JANET
That's just bullcrap people say. They say they see it moving and BS. 

SONYA
Wait, show it to me again. 

JANET shows her the picture. This time, It moves even more, as if the phone is staying still as CAMERON turns away. 

SONYA
RIGHT THERE.

JEREMY
Right where? 

SONYA takes the phone from JANET, backs out and backs into it. CAMERON, again, moves from her pose to turning around, this time slightly more. Her hands have dropped from the camera, as if something else is holding it up for her. Her head is a blur, nothing but blonde hair turned three-quarters of the way around. 

SONYA
It just did it again. 

JEREMY and JANET share a look. JANET slowly takes her phone back. 

JANET
Please don't break my phone, if you're gonna break a phone, you should join the civilized world like the rest of us and finally get one. 

SONYA
I don't fucking need a phone-, 

JANET
We know, we know-, 

EVERYONE
The government is always watching. 

They all exit the room as SONYA sits.

------
SCENE: After work

SONYA packs up for the day and leaves work, saying good by to individuals as she leaves. She walks down the sidewalk and looks up at the sky. She reads her way through public transit and pays with cash. She walks past her house to an italian restuarant. She enters inside to a nice, quaint rustic style eatery. MARIO leans over the hosts bench. 

MARIO
Right on time sunshine. 

SONYA
Predictable girl. 

MARIO
not bad for our business. 

SONYA stands awkwardly. 

MARIO
Usual spot and order? 

SONYA
It's never any different.

SONYA sits at a table for one, while MARIO immediately brings her a bottle of wine. MARIO cracks open the wine and pours for her. When he stops, she slides it to him. He smirks and pours more. She takes a big swig of her wine. MARIO types on his phone a bit before the bell dings. He brings the food over to SONYA's table. 

SONYA
That was-, 

MARIO
Quick? yeah well-, 

He motions to the empty diner. MARIO pulls out the parmesean grindr. 

MARIO
Say when. 

SONYA let's him go. He repeats say when two more times before she stops him. He sits down at a booth nearby when his phone dings. He shakes his head. 

MARIO
Not this shit again Romero. 

He goes back to texting and the phone dings again. He looks at SONYA eating. 

MARIO
Hey Sonya, lemme ask you something. 

He comes to her booth. 

MARIO
You heard of the-, 

He looks at her. 

MARIO
Wait, I just remembered you live under the rock. 

SONYA
That's the point of being tech free. 

MARIO
What kinda super hacker goes tech free. 

SONYA
The one that knows too much. 

MARIO
Okay lady, you sound like a Matrix Character. Anyway, my friends keep trying to send me pics of this challenge to see if I see anything, but no one ever says they see anything. 

SONYA
What? 

MARIO shows her picture of CAMERON and this time, she moves more, almost starting into a sprint. 

SONYA
Jesus fucking christ is she running? 

MARIO
RUnning? What? 

SONYA
Don't fuck with me MArio. 

MARIO
You don't fuck with me? She just taking a selfie. 

SONYA looks at the picture again and it starts from her on the selfie to her beginning to sprint. 

SONYA
Now she's running farther. 

MARIO
Oh...Okay then. 

SONYA
No seriously, just let me show you. 

SHe tries to grab MARIO's phone. He struggles with her until she let's go. PAULIE is staring from the kitchen. MARIO stares at her, too. 

MARIO
I gotta tend to some tables. 

SONYA
MARIO sorry i just-, 

MARIO
It's cool. You got that strong ass grip, girl. I thought you'd crack my fucking phone. 

SONYA eats in thought. 

SCENE

NIGHT-BED. 

SONYA lays in her bed, awake. The short clip of CAMERON replays. In her head. She tosses and turns and tries to sleep but she simply cannot.

SCENE 2

Morning-the next day.

SONYA is groggily typing at work, unrested from the night before. She looks around before typing in reddit on her computer. It's blocked by the network. 

SONYA
Hey Jeremy!

He pops his head up over the cubicle.

JEREMY
Heya.

SONYA 
Good God, you're too happy in the morning. 

JEREMY
And depression rules your life. 

JANET
Jeremy! What did I tell you about being honest?

JEREMY
It's not meant for the modern world. 

SONYA
And you guys are our HR department?

JEREMY
Could be worse. We could be an actual corporate entity, then you'd really hate us. 

SONYA
Okay, well, I was trying to search up a coding colution online, and the one website that seemed to give good solutions was Reddit-,

JEREMY
Ooooh, I  know what you're gonna ask and it's a no go.

SONYA
What was I gonna ask?

JANET (in a mocking tone)
Can wwe have facebook? Can we have Twitter? Can we have myspace?

SONYA
who wants myspace

JEREMY
The Last remaining millenials. 

He looks SONYA up and down. 

SONYA
I'm Late Gen Z. 

JEREMY
Very. 

JANET
but it's company policy. No social media. We're here to work. If you wanna scroll Ticking Tock.

In the moment, JANET opens up a social media app. 

SONYA
Hey, can I see that for a second. 

JANET
What-, 

SONYA snatches the phone and looks for CAMERON's account. Janet snatches her phone back.

JANET
Oh my god, are you still on this?

SONYA
You really don't see it. 

Janet Looks at her. SONYA snatches back JANET's phone and shows her the picture. It moves as she points. JEREMY walks over to look and shares a glance with JANET. He gently grabs the phone. 

JEREMY
Yes... we see. a phone... magic. 

SONYA
No, the pictures moving. You can see her. She's turning away and running. 

It becomes ppin quiet. SONYA looks around to see the whole office is staring at her, including TINA and ROBBIE.  

TINA
I don't know y'all, that sounds like psychosis but imma shut up. 

ROBBIE
You think she Gonna snap soon? I put my money on next Wednesday.
 
TINA and ROBBIE walk away. 

SONYA rolls her eyes. ON her computer, she opens her terminal and starts getting to work. She's typing fast, navigating through folders, opening and editing files, testing network connections. Eventually, she opens a browser, types in reddit and it works. 

SONYA
Still got it. 

She creates a profile, her name is not-delulu-iswear-89. And she starts to research The Cameraman. She goes between making social media accounts to go to the pages of the disappeared people.She starts with CAMERON and sees the entirety of her last moments. Her running away, being grabbed by film and falling down, being dragged out of frame. A man steps into view, he has the head of an old film camera and is wearing a lovely suit. He leans in and points at SONYA. She exits the screen. Curious, she searches up a list of victims on reddit.  

She watches the pictures-become videos, increasingly showing more and more of how they are sucked away, grabbed and ensnared by film strips, being dragged to their death. She is watching another one, a picture of a man, in a forest, he looks sweaty and tired, loooking up from the ground. The picture shows him srawling backwards as film ensanres him. 

The day moves around SONYA as she watches the pictures play out and read articles. SONYA is in a vortex of information, unaware of the outside world when JANET sets a muffin on the table. 

JANET
Daily fiber girly. 

SONYA
Thanks Janet. 

JANET is about to leave when she notices SONYA isn't leaving. 

JANET
Squash that big bug. 

SONYA
WHat? 

JANET
I just have been hearing you code all day, and usually you're gone by 5. 

SONYA
It's five? 

JANET
30, yes girlie you've been working. Remember to lock up. 

Scene: up all night

A montage. 


video one: 
a young man, wearing glasses is on the screen
Personally, I think it began in 2020 after covid hit the wave. We were all tied to our screens, tied to our cameras when soemthing happened. It was as if something was awakened. 

video two: 
No one thinks it's strange? 5 goung people with their lives ahead of them, thriving lives, all delete their socials, with one selfie, #saycheese, and they're never to be found again. And we're just supposed to believe it's suicide because that's what the cops found out? I think it's a government Psyop. No... a conspiracy. It's probably experimentation. 

video three:
There have only been 4 so far, CAMERON being the one who put it on the map, as she was a famous influencer who just disappeared. Personally, I think it's a mass psychosis brought upon bby 21st century mundane madness. People are so obsessed with perfection that fulfillment is lacking, and the soul suffers. It harkens to depression, deleting everything. I just don't understand the whole, #saycheese thing. Is it a meme? 

SCENE: THE LORE\\SONYA's PResentation

Morning-The office Exterior as JANET and JEREMY are giggling,Walking towards the doors. They enter, going through the hallway and rounding a corner to a racoon eyed, tired and disheveled SONYA. 

SONYA
HI. 

JANET
Jesus Christ. 

Jeremy
Jumpscare. 

SONYA
Good morning Good morning. Did you all sleep well? 

JANET
Did you even? 

SONYA
No, but that's not the point. I'll prove it to you. 
 
JEREMY
Prove What-,

She pulls both JEREMY and JANET by their arms into the meeting room. A powerpoint is running. 

okay okay okay. So. the first one was Hiroki, Mitsuri. 

She clicks a button and it shows Hiroki, Happy and smiling holding a camera, about to take a picture. 

SONYA
He was a japanese boy in indiana. He had a love for photography and filmmaking and set out to film the world during the lockdown. he's making movies and making work, and then all of a sudden, he goes missing. But nothing on his profiles or websites or anything but one picture. 

SONYA points to a picture with Hiroki, wide eyed with a forced smile, teary and snot faced at what seems to be a bridge. 

SONYA
They have never found his body either. 

She clicks a beautiful girl with curly hair is on th dancefloor, glowing. 

SONYA
INA Washington, a student at Westmonty high. Cheerleader, apparently a sweet girl and not suicidal. 

CLICK. INA at the edge of a forest. Her eyes a bleary and far away but she forces up a smile and two fingers. 

SONYA
This was her last picture near Garamound Forest, and she hasn't been found. 

click. A picture of a handsome man. Paul Logan. Brown hair, grunge looking but sweet. He sits on a couch with a black boy, James Hardy.  

SONYA
Pay attention to the one with brown hair. That's Paul Logan. Freshmen loner in college. 

CLICK. Paul is in the middle of the forest, on the ground, appearing to be backing up but smiling. His eyes scream terror. 

SONYA
This was paul's final moment. He has yet to be found. And this. 

CLICK. 

SONYA
IS CAMERON WALKER. Beautiful influencer and model. 

CLICK. 

SONYA
Her last picture taken was on the same street where she was supposed to go to a party. The uber drive who dropped her off said that she seemed fine when he left. 

JANET
OKAY....

SONYA
Don't you guys see, something is hunting them. 

JEREMY
the spirit of depression. 

He mimics blowing his brains out and him and Janet laugh. 

SONYA
Guys, this is serious, something is taking people. 

JANET
And this has taken up enough of my time. Thanks for the early mornign presentation. 

SONYA
But Janet. 

JEREMY
I would go home, maybe get some sleep. 

He pats her dark circles. 

JEREMY (cont) 
Yeah, you've been up all fucking night. Get some beauty sleep. 

SONYA looks at them bewildered. 

SONYA
Do you guys jsut not care? 

JEREMY 
No. 

JANET
NEVER DID. 

SCENE did I just see?
